 MTG_naval_treaty.12.t: "Second London Naval Conference"
 MTG_naval_treaty.12.d: "Following the unprecedented carnage and expense of the Great War, the popular mood across the globe was peace and disarmament, which reigned throughout the 1920s. As an extension of conditions agreed in previous treaty for naval disarmament, the Second London Naval Conference was held on 9 Dec, 1935. However, the negotiation between signatories of the London Naval Treaty is anything but peace, with terms below presented as the final resolution until its expiration in 1942.\n\n1. No capital ship shall exceed 35,000 tons standard displacement or carry a gun with a caliber over 14 in (356mm).\n\n2. No aircraft-carrier shall exceed 23,000 tons or carry a gun with a caliber over 6.1 in (155mm).\n\n3. No light surface vessel shall exceed 8,000 tons standard displacement. But if the requirements of the national security of any signatories are, in his opinion, materially affected by the actual or authorized amount of construction by any power of light surface vessels, it has the right to lay down or acquire light surface vessels with maximum standard displacement of 10,000 tons.\n\n4. Provided that if any of the signatories of the Washington Naval Treaty should fail to enter into an agreement to conform to this provision prior to the date of the coming into force of the present treaty, the maximum caliber of guns carried on capital ships shall be 16 in (406mm)."
