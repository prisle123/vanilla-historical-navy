 naval_equipment: "Ships"
 vnr_ship_hull_submarine_1_desc: "The first submersible warships actually capable of effective combat actions, these designs are significant improvements over their predecessors. With diesel-electric engines replacing the primarily petrol-electric engines of the first submarines, they have greatly improved range and surface speed compared with their predecessors. In combat with enemy warships, they act mainly as submersible light torpedo boats, but lack the submerged speed or endurance to remain underwater for more than relatively brief periods. These are the submarines that were used by the major naval powers during the World War."
 vnr_ship_hull_submarine_2_desc: "The evolution of the earlier submarine designs, some of these warships took 'cruiser' submarines ideas further, with larger guns and a greater emphasis on surface abilities, while others look in the other direction, seeking to increase underwater capabilities and performance."
 vnr_ship_hull_submarine_3_desc: "The gains made by some earlier designs in extending underwater range, speed, and overall abilities, led to the turn in submarine development away from 'cruiser' types and back towards vessels with a greater emphasis on underwater capabilities. Vastly improved over earlier types, these submarines carry potent payloads of torpedoes and are a legitimate threat to almost all surface ships. However, they are still limited in submerged duration, range, and speed, and remain vulnerable when surfaced, especially to aircraft."
 vnr_ship_hull_submarine_4_desc: "With greatly increased battery capacity, advanced systems to refresh air while still submerged, and overall refined designs, these are the first submarines intended to be able to remain submerged for most of the duration of their time at sea. As such, they mark a massive shift in naval warfare, and the ascendancy of submarines to being true terrors. Such warships offer the ability to dominate the oceans to those nations that developed and deployed them."
 vnr_ship_hull_light_1_desc: "The World War brought a new demand for destroyers- not only were they required to protect their fleets, but they were also stretched thin to protect the Entente shipping lines as well. To meet this need, destroyer designs were streamlined, entering mass production to keep up with demand. Ships of this era are typically 1000 tons, and travel at a top speed of 34 knots, while carrying a larger pair of torpedoes than their forebears."
 vnr_ship_hull_light_2_desc: "The trend during World War I had been towards larger destroyers with heavier armaments. A number of opportunities to fire at capital ships had been missed during the war, because destroyers had expended all their torpedoes in an initial salvo. To address this, destroyers were strengthened in terms of hull and armament. Destroyers in this period had larger hulls with a displacement of about 1,500 to 2,000 tons, led by slightly larger destroyer leader."
 vnr_ship_hull_light_3_desc: "By 1935, with increasingly potent new aircraft designs entering service, as well as several navies deploying more carriers, while there was still some doubt about just how useful the carriers would be in open warfare, concern over the potential threat that aircraft might pose to warships was growing. Continued exercises had shown the world that the carrier has a purpose in the navy. As a result, destroyers saw the introduction of the dual purpose primary armament, granting a vastly improved anti-aircraft role to the destroyer, again increasing their usefulness. These ships, displacing up to 2,500 tons, often carry increased payloads of torpedoes to offset the reduced torpedo load-out on more modern cruisers."
 vnr_ship_hull_light_4_desc: "With the start of the Second World War the world's navies needed cheap anti-aircraft platforms. The success with carrier combat had shown the world that they are suited for more than just recon and anti-carrier duties and they are required for modern anti-capital ship warfare. Advanced anti-submarine technologies also are playing an essential role in combating the major threat to convoy operations, they and the anti-aircraft platforms intensified demands for more destroyers. While previously destroyer investments were being lowered in favour of cruisers and the new battlecruisers, destroyers begin to return to the fore as an essential part of both the fleet, and the convoy system. Often not larger than their predecessors they are far more technologically advanced, mostly adopting flush decks and far larger torpedo armaments."
 vnr_ship_hull_light_5_desc: "Near the end of the Second World War, the navies of the world were forced to adapt to new submarines that could stay submerged for almost indefinite periods of time, carriers which are loaded full of planes more than capable of destroying capital ships, with big gun cruisers quickly becoming irrelevant in the face of carriers and submarines. The future role of the escort for the fleet is being taken over almost solely by destroyers in the minds of most naval theorists, with dual purpose rapid firing turrets destroying any planes that dare cross her path in an attempt to dive bomb her. The displacement of these vessels was increased as well, often coming up to 3,000 tons as designers load them with more and more anti-aircraft weapons, as well as more primary guns."
 torpedo_cruiser: "Torpedo Cruiser"
 torpedo_cruiser_desc: "Based on the Jeune École ('Young School') doctrine which held that small warships armed with torpedoes could effectively and cheaply defeat much larger battleships, these cruisers are primarily armed with torpedoes. Most of the torpedo cruisers fell out of favour in most of navies in the 1890s, though many other navies continued to acquire them into the early 1900s. The modern torpedo cruisers are designed to use torpedoes that submarines cannot carry."
 early_ship_hull_cruiser_desc: "Until the end of the 19th century, unprotected cruisers still occupied a place in the fleet, while protected cruisers with armor began to emerge, and larger armored cruisers gradually entered the navy's sight. The rapid development of cruisers in the early 20th century had several types with various sizes, from the battlecruiser with firepower and protection close to a dreadnought, to the flotilla leaders which acted alongside destroyers, these cutting-edge cruisers have greatly surpassed the capital ships of the past."

 vnr_ship_hull_cruiser_2_desc: "Naval construction in the 1920s and 1930s was limited by international treaties designed to prevent the repetition of the Dreadnought arms race of the early 20th century. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 placed limits on the construction of ships with a standard displacement of more than 10,000 tons and an armament of guns larger than 8-inch. A number of navies commissioned classes of cruisers at the top end of this limit, known as \"treaty cruisers\"."
 vnr_ship_hull_cruiser_3_desc: "The interwar period saw refinements of cruisers within the frame of Washington Naval Treaty. With politics and finances still constraining many naval powers, the produced designs are only slightly larger in size than the previous generation, instead seeing upgrades in firepower through the use of bigger guns or the growing adoption of triple turrets and quadruple torpedo tubes. The growing importance of aviation in naval warfare also led to the adoption of high-angle dual-purpose mounts, supplemented by a growing array of autocannons. However, there were already some attempts to break the limits set on cruisers.\n\nInstall §YLarge Cruiser Role§! on §YCruiser Hull§! to unlock §YLarge Cruiser Battery§! and §YLarge Cruiser Armor§!."
 vnr_ship_hull_cruiser_4_desc: "Thanks to increased available funding, the new cruisers built at the end of the interwar period and the beginning of the Second World War again increased in size. While the primary armament's calibre remained unchanged once more, with few exceptions, their firepower was increased further by adding an extra turret or raising the number of guns in each turret. Secondary armaments was upgraded with further twin dual-purpose guns and even more dedicated anti-aircraft armament, often linked with improved fire controls. This generation also see the growing adoption of radar systems on cruisers."
 vnr_ship_hull_cruiser_5_desc: "The cruisers of the late-war and early post-war period remain similar to the ones of the early war, while incorporating the numerous lessons learned throughout. With aircraft confirmed to be one of the greatest threats to ships, designers focused on improving AA capabilities even further through better fire-control, improving coordination between batteries and radar. Some navies are also experimenting with autoloading mechanisms for the main armament, dramatically improving their rates of fire."
 early_ship_hull_heavy_desc: "Designed shortly before the World War began, and completed while it raged, these classes represent the highest level of naval development prior to the start of that conflict. They were the fleet-leading warships of the war, and remain highly potent long after it ended. While they are notably faster than the Dreadnoughts before them, their most notable differentiating feature is their escalated armament- they carry eight to ten main guns, most in twin turrets but a few in new triple turrets. Their devastating firepower and heavy armour guaranteed that they would be at the heart of their battle fleets in World War, but those continued advances came at quickly escalating prices. Even more so than the warships before them these classes demanded huge investments, though they were only shadow of what was to come."

Even more so than the warships before them these classes demanded huge investments, though they were only shadow of what was to come."
 vnr_ship_hull_heavy_2_desc: "The inter-war period saw the battleship subjected to strict international limitations to prevent a costly arms race breaking out. Faced with the prospect of a naval arms race against the United Kingdom and Japan, which would in turn have led to a possible Pacific war, the United States was keen to conclude the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. This treaty limited the number and size of battleships that each major nation could possess. Designs like the British N3-class battleship, the American South Dakota class, and the Japanese Kii class—all of which continued the trend to larger ships with bigger guns and thicker armor—never got off the drawing board. Those designs which were commissioned during this period were referred to as treaty battleships."
 vnr_ship_hull_heavy_3_desc: "The naval powers extensively upgraded and modernized their Great War–era battleships during the 1930s. Among the new features were an increased tower height and stability for the optical rangefinder equipment (for gunnery control), more armor (especially around turrets) to protect against plunging fire and aerial bombing, and additional anti-aircraft weapons. Even when war threatened again in the late 1930s, battleship construction did not regain the level of importance it had held in the years before World War I. The "building holiday" imposed by the naval treaties meant the capacity of dockyards worldwide had shrunk, and the strategic position had changed."
 vnr_ship_hull_heavy_4_desc: "With the Second World War on the horizon and international tensions higher than ever, designers are looking to construct a new generation of ships to fight in the upcoming war. While some nations had transitioned their naval hopes to carriers, others still insist that the carrier can only provide a supplementary role, rather than replacing the primary anti-capital ship role of the battleship. These nations instead retool their newer designs, focusing on improved armour layouts and more effective guns and turrets, as well as improved speeds."
 vnr_ship_hull_heavy_5_desc: "At the close of the Second World War, the Great Powers started to understand: naval air power had proved victorious over all gun capital ships. However, several nations persist with the development of Battleships, as shore bombardment platforms, prestige projects and support for carriers within the fleet or even try to promote their old role. Some designers load their battleships with anti-aircraft batteries to increase the chances of survival. Although many of these battleships may continue to operate for many years, they are already viewed as obsolete by some nations."
 vnr_ship_hull_carrier_1_desc: "Developed in the '30s, these ships are designed to provide aerial reconnaissance and light fighter coverage for fleets primarily focused on more 'conventional' warship forces. Their range is significantly increased, and efforts were made to make them fast enough to keep up with fleets operating at full speed in open oceans."
 vnr_ship_hull_carrier_2_desc: "As major naval combat operations in the naval aviation age demonstrated the power of aircraft to seriously affect battles at sea, many powers found themselves having fallen behind in the development of their carrier forces. While fleet carriers are quickly shown to be the most potent of their kin, they are also massive ships that require a long time and large amount of resources to construct. In the rush to increase their ability to project air power into the oceans, the naval powers turned to designs like these, enlarged versions of the existing lighter carriers, to try to quickly bolster their naval aviation capacity."
 vnr_ship_hull_carrier_3_desc: "Continued development of carrier design led to much larger models, these ships are approaching the size of the first fleet carriers, while incorporating all of the design improvements made in the intervening years. Most have significant armour protection and withering AA firepower, while also being highly mechanically reliable. However, they abandoned concept of large calibre secondary armament in exchange for smaller dual purpose guns."
 vnr_ship_hull_super_heavy_1_desc: "The rapid increase of resources devoted to naval construction after the end of major land conflict during the Great War initially produced these designs, which featured the beginnings of the trends towards sudden growth in size, firepower, armour, calibre and of course, cost. Such vessels set the world's leading naval powers apart from the mere pretenders to greatness, but they have their issues; their rapid development and rushed construction led to design flaws and persistent mechanical problems. These designs are armed with eight to ten 18 inch or equivalent main guns, and have the protection to go toe-to-toe with similarly armed ships. As the Naval Holiday came, these monsters were buried by time."

 ship_hull_cruiser_desc: "In the middle of the 19th century, cruiser came to be a classification of the ships intended for cruising distant waters, for commerce raiding, and for scouting for the battle fleet. It came in a wide variety of sizes, from smaller protected cruiser to large armored cruiser. With the advent of the dreadnought battleship before World War, armored cruiser had gradually evolved into battlecruiser, while the direct successors to protected cruisers could be placed on a consistent scale of warship size until the London Naval Conference officially set the standards for light and heavy cruisers."

 vnr_ship_hull_carrier_conversion_bb: "Converted Battleship Hull"
 vnr_ship_hull_carrier_conversion_bb_desc: "The first large aircraft carriers, these ships are mainly built on hulls that were originally intended for capital warships but, because of the Washington Naval Treaty, converted and completed as carriers. Only a handful of navies built such ships, and their designs varied greatly; their aircraft capacities ranged from the low sixties to a hundred. There are constants though, such as retained heavily armoured belts and other gun-warship features. Semi-experimental and unreliable, they are still incredibly formidable weapons, and laid the foundations for following generations of fleet carriers."
 vnr_ship_hull_carrier_conversion_ca: "Early Carrier Hull"
 vnr_ship_hull_carrier_conversion_ca_desc: "Having learned from the experience of using seaplane tenders, those navies with the resources to do so began work on the next generation of ships that could carry aircraft at sea. Unlike their predecessors, these carriers are designed with flight decks to allow for aircraft to both fly off of them and to then return and land on them. Converted from civilian ships and seaplane tenders, or built on purpose, most of these ships are limited by having relatively cramped flight decks and hangars, but they definitely demonstrate that ships are capable of effectively operating air complements at sea."

 vnr_ship_hull_pre_dreadnought_desc: "Followed the design of the British Majestic-class of the late 1890s, Pre-Dreadnought battleships replaced the ironclad battleships of the 1870s and 1880s. Built from steel, and protected by hardened steel armour, pre-dreadnought battleships carry a main battery of very heavy guns in barbettes supported by one or more secondary batteries of lighter weapons.\n\nSince the 'Dreadnought' design made them obsoleted since before the World War, coupled with the gigantic rise of Dreadnought-based designs in the previous three decades, only a few of them are still in service."

 GER_vnr_ship_hull_cruiser_panzerschiff: "Panzerschiff"
 vnr_ship_hull_cruiser_panzerschiff_desc: "As a radical measure to bypass the Treaty of Versailles, the Reichsmarine first adopted panzerschiff (armored ship) as temporary capital ships. Having an intermediate firepower between heavy cruisers and battlecruisers, the panzerschiff heralded quite an advantage in an one-on-one combat against cruisers, but it would be rendered useless facing an organized fleet.\nSimilar designs were also seen in the early proposals of IJN such as the B-65 project but never realized."
 vnr_ship_hull_cruiser_coastal_defense_ship: "Coastal Defense Ship"
 vnr_ship_hull_cruiser_coastal_defense_ship_desc: "Coastal defence ships are small, often cruiser-sized warships that sacrificed speed and range for armour and armament.

 vnr_ship_hull_light_6_desc: "After the Second World War, conventional destroyers built during this period were significantly larger than wartime ships and had fully automatic main guns, unit machinery, radar, sonar, and antisubmarine weapons such as the squid mortar. The advent of surface-to-air missiles and surface-to-surface missiles in the 1950s changed naval warfare. Guided missile destroyers were developed to carry these weapons and protect the fleet from air, submarine, and surface threats."
 vnr_ship_hull_cruiser_6: "Cold War Cruiser Hull"
 vnr_ship_hull_cruiser_6_desc: "The rise of air power during World War II dramatically changed the nature of naval combat. Even the fastest cruisers could not maneuver quickly enough to evade aerial attack, and aircraft now had torpedoes, allowing moderate-range standoff capabilities.\n\nWith battleships completely outdated in the advent of missiles, cruisers became the largest capital ships in the world in the second half of the 20th century. Some of them adopted full missile designs and even applied nuclear engines."
 vnr_ship_hull_submarine_5: "Cold War Submarine Hull"
 vnr_ship_hull_submarine_5_desc: "In the 1950s, nuclear power partially replaced diesel–electric propulsion. Equipment was also developed to extract oxygen from sea water. These two innovations gave submarines the ability to remain submerged for weeks or months."
