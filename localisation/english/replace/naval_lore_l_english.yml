 naval_lore.0.t: "Hull Classification Symbol"
 naval_lore.0.d: "The hull classification symbol used by the United States Navy is considered one of the most effective ways to identify ships, with the Royal Navy and other European navies applying some similar system, though the definition of warships varies across the world.\n\nThe system was a simple one in which each ship received a number that was appended to its ship type, fully spelled out, and added parenthetically after the ship's name when deemed necessary to avoid confusion between ships. A lot of symbols were never used but archived in naval documents.\n\nThis introduction is sorted by the role of the ship.\n\n§RCVH:§! Heavy aircraft carrier is usually converted from a battleship or dreadnought, but large carrier with considerable capacity also exists.\n§RCV:§! A standard fleet carrier with medium capacity.\n§RCVL:§! A light carrier has smaller capacity than a fleet carrier, and is used for escorting and anti-submarine warfare.\n§RBB:§! Battleship dominates the oceans with its heavy artillery and armor.\n§RFBB:§! Fast battleship is a mixture of battleship and battlecruiser, which typically has higher speed.\n§RSHBB:§! Super heavy battleship is the most formidable and unsinkable monster built by human.\n§RB:§! Pre-dreadnought is the capital ship before the invention of dreadnought, it lacks the uniform caliber to achieve central fire control.\n§RBC:§!

Old armored cruiser was popular before the Great War, it is outdated despite superior equipments.\n§RC:§!

Light cruiser is the successor to protected cruisers, smaller but more flexible with its 6in guns.\n§RCLAA:§! Anti-aircraft cruiser is a light cruiser specialized for anti-air missions.\n§RCS:§! Scout cruiser can vary in size but possessing some advanced reconnaissance abilities.\n§RBM:§! Monitor puts heavy artillery on a light hull which can only operate in shallow seas and rivers.\n§RDD:§! Destroyer is the backbone of the fleet used for torpedo attacks and minelaying.\n§RDL:§! Destroyer Leader is a large destroyer to command a destroyer squad in the combat.\n§RD:§! Torpedo destroyer is a collection of small torpedo boats and destroyers built before the Great War.\n§RDE:§! Escort destroyer is a small warship to protect the convoy from submarines.\n§RFF:§!
