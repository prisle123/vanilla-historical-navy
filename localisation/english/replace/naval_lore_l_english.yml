The 20th century witnessed the rise of naval powers, and the navy has been playing a vital role in global strategy.\n\nEver since the Anglo-German Naval Arms Race, navies of the world have been innovating and expanding their fleet. From wolfpacks beneath the water to behemoths on the surface, modernized warships dominate every inch of the sea."

 naval_lore_desc_1_eng: "Possessing the largest navy in the Victorian Era, the United Kingdom has always been the strongest naval power since the mid-19th century, and led the naval development through its unparalleled technologies.\n\nIn the 1900s, Europe was on the brink of war when Germany's ambition to pursue a place in the sun threatened old colonial empires. The Royal Navy got unprecedented investments against expanding German forces. The launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1905 started the naval evolution, whose uniform caliber marked the advent of central fire control and changed the rule of naval combat. Other powers developed their dreadnoughts in merely four years. The United Kingdom, however, answered with four classes of dreadnoughts including St. Vincent- and Bellerophon-class. With superfire structure achieved on HMS Orion, it outdated all dreadnoughts built before 1909. The King George V- and Iron Duke-class also followed such layout.\n\nAs the ultimate product of the John Fisher school, battlecruiser that trades protection for speed was invented, represented by the groundbreaking HMS Invincible. Launched before the war, the Queen Elizabeth-class sailing at 24kn had set the tone for fast battleships, with seven economical but slower Revenge-class (two were refitted as Renown-class) ordered to ensure predominance.\n\nThe Royal Navy entered the war with its Two-Power Standard, owning the largest fleet globally. It engaged German High Seas Fleet in some indecisive battles during the first two years of the war, trying to maintain its control over the sea. In 1916, the battle at Jutland changed everything, ending with both sides claiming victory. There was no doubt that the Royal Navy still held strategic advantages by enforcing its blockade against German war machine, but the battle had exposed flaws in its ships. In the face of heavy losses at Jutland, the Admiralty started to review its on-going battlecruiser programs, and paused the production of Admiral-class.\n\nAlthough British stood unchallenged on the sea, the cracks were to appear on the land. With Russian Empire collapsing into a civil war, the Entente was in desperate need of support from the New World, while the Zimmermann Telegram offered a perfect chance for American intervention.\n\nAs overwhelming American forces joined Allies offensive in mid-1917, it quickly forced the German Empire to pull back from French territory in merely a year. When the Treaty of Versailles was signed, the United Kingdom once again secured its world dominance, and grabbed most of German possessions in Africa and Asia-Pacific.\n\nOld rival falls, new one rises. As the Kaiserliche Marine, the greatest enemy, scuttled its fleet at Scapa Flow, the Royal Navy was at a crossroad where its superiority established centuries ago was challenged by the United States Navy and Imperial Japanese Navy. Following the fact that the army seized to expand post-war, major navies of the world proceeded the new generation of battleships designed during the Great War. Nevertheless, Britain only had one Admiral-class under construction, and estimates by the Admiralty were that by the early 1920s, the Royal Navy would be behind in ships.\n\nThe original plan was to build three battleships and one battlecruiser in 1921, and again in 1922, but this was then changed to four G3-class battlecruisers to be built first, presumably to be followed by the same number of battleships (potentially N3-class) in the following year. However, these plans were soon cancelled upon the Washington Naval Treaty."
 naval_lore_desc_1_usa: "In 1890, The Influence of Seapower Upon History by Alfred Mahan was published. It discussed the various factors needed to support and achieve sea power, with emphasis on having the largest and most powerful fleet. For the United States, the theory justified investments in the navy, allowing expansionism to gaze at farther frontiers from the Caribbean to the Pacific.\n\nThe election of Theodore Roosevelt in 1901 was considered a milestone to the US Navy. Influenced by the Russo-Japanese War and the launch of HMS Dreadnought, he gave greenlight to the naval expansion and organized the global tour of Great White Fleet in 1907, heralding the rise of US naval power. By 1914, US had commissioned over 10 dreadnoughts in just 8 years.\n\nAmerica observed a strict neutrality during the war, and its international arms trade with both sides of the war led to plenty of cash flowing towards Washington. The economic boom contributed to its naval expansion. In an attempt to build the largest navy in the world, American naval theorists believed a mediocre but unified design should be pursued to simplify fleet command and maximize efficiency. Shortly after the outbreak of war in Europe, the first group of standard-type battleships, Nevada and Oklahoma were launched, bringing innovations such as triple guns and all-or-nothing armor scheme. They were followed by two Pennsylvania-class in a few months. As the war in Europe raging, the United States decided to stick with Standard-Battleship strategy, and steadily laid down more new ships, but they were mostly copies of previous designs with few modifications. Increasing naval budget led to complaints from Congress, and prompted Senator Benjamin Tillman to ask for a maximum battleship to end the naval race once and for all.\n\nHowever, the Naval Act of 1916 (Big Navy Act) had been signed by President Wilson before Tillman's proposal could even be considered, and it called for the construction of ten battleships and six battlecruisers to build \"incomparably, the greatest Navy in the world\". Foreseeing developments of European navies, the General Board wanted to depart from the standard series and build faster ships, but the Secretary of the Navy, Josephus Daniels, overruled them and denied any radical modifications on Tennessee-class. It released the signal that USN would still abide by the standard-type strategy regardless of naval innovation happening across the Atlantic.\n\nWhen the United States joined the war on the Allies' side in 1917, there was no fight left on the sea since German stationed most of its ships in fortified ports, and this continued until the end of the war. But the USN still played a role in protecting and shipping hundreds of thousands of soldiers and marines of the American Expeditionary Force and war supplies across the Atlantic in U-boat infested waters.\n\nStarting from this point, the strength of USN grew under its ambitious naval expansion program as planned. It first funded the construction of four Colorado-class battleships in 1917, America's first attempt to apply 16-inch guns, and another six Lexington-class battlecruisers with similar firepower but lighter armor. Together with the Lexingtons, six South Dakota-class battleships were ordered in 1920, being slightly faster than Colorado and mounted more guns.\n\nHowever, none of these ships, except for the Colorados, could come to reality because of the Washington Naval Treaty signed in 1922."
 naval_lore_desc_1_jap: "Empowered by results of the Meiji Restoration in culture and industry, Japan had already built up a considerable naval power with imported battleships by the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War. Victories over Qing and Russia at the turn of the 20th century marked a new dawn in Japan's regional hegemony and a rapid growth of its navy.\n\nOn the execuse of Anglo-Japanese Alliance, Japan declared war against Germany upon the start of the Great War and occupied its possessions in the Pacific. Without a nearby battlefront, Japanese resources were diverted to naval construction. Once dwarfed by Europeans, the status of Japanese Navy had been improved since the purchase of Kongo, which was the first Japanese warship to embrace firepower of super-dreadnought level. It didn't take too long before Japan's first effort to build its own dreadnoughts of western standard, and they would be two Fuso-class, and two Ise-class with modified turret layout.\n\nUpon that, the Eight-Eight Fleet initiative was proposed by Naval General Staff to fund several shipbuilding programs in the following years. It started in 1917 with two Nagato-class armed with eight 410mm guns, and two Tosa-class with an extra turret in 1920. Japan's breakthrough in steam turbines allowed them to sail at a top speed of 26kn, faster than any battleships built by other countries. Alongside Tosa, four Amagi-class battlecruisers were ordered to lead the scouting force but later cancelled after 1922. A few squadrons of Kamikaze- and Mutsuki-class destroyers were then built to counter the threat from the United States Navy.\n\nHowever, Japan's attempt to catch up with the first-line naval powers was ended in 1921 by Washington Naval Treaty, which asked Japan to cancel and scrap all the building plans beyond Nagato, even though Mutsu has been commissioned before the conference. This was unacceptable to the Japanese delegation and they agreed to keep Mutsu in exchange for scrapping the obsolete dreadnought Settsu, while also allowing the US to keep Colorado-class battleships which were fitting out.\n\nJapan was known for its advance in naval aviation with precursors dating back to the establishment of the Commission on Naval Aeronautical Research in 1912. The commission led conversion of several vessels to seaplane carriers, and its experience would be crucial in completing Hosho, the first dedicated aircraft carrier in history. Unlike battleship, aircraft carrier was not heavily restricted by the treaty of 1922, which encouraged multiple navies in the world to convert uncompleted battleship designs to carriers. Japan's effort would be Kaga, Amagi and Akagi, with Amagi severely damaged in the 1923 Kanto Earthquake and turned out to be unrepairable.\n\nDespite a considerable presence in the Pacific, IJN was inferior to American naval forces based in this area, this was made even worse after 1922 when the US concentrated all its battleships to Battle Fleet and deployed them on the West Coast."
 naval_lore_desc_1_fra: "Founded in the 17th century, the French Navy was one of the oldest navies still in continual service, with precursors dating back to the Middle Ages. It has taken part in key events in history including the Napoleonic War and the Great War, and played an important role in establishing and securing the French colonial empire for 400 years. The French Navy pioneered several innovations in naval technologies, such as the first ironclad and first mechanically propelled submarine.\n\nHowever, the development of French Navy slowed down when naval races between the United Kingdom and Germany grew in intensity. It was not until 1910 that four Courbet-class dreadnoughts were laid, which were characterized by longer but thinner waterline belt against underwater hits. In 1912, three Bretagne-class that improved from the Courbet were ordered, but they only saw limited service in the war. They were followed by five Normandie-class in 1913, the only warships to adopt quadruple batteries at that time.\n\nFrance entered the war with relatively few modern vessels, and naval production was hampered as the main French effort was on land. While Royal Navy held the North Sea, the French Navy was active in the Mediterranean, where they mostly kept watch on the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Once Italy entered the war on the Allied side in May 1915, the French Navy moved to more forward bases at Brindisi on the Italian Adriatic coast and the Greek island of Corfu. From there, it launched an amphibious invasion on Athens in 1916, forcing the pro-German Greek government to side with the Entente. French destroyer squadrons also played an important role in countering Germany's U-boat campaign by regularly patrolling the seas and escorting convoys.\n\nWhen the Treaty of Versailles was signed, France has lost a generation of brave young men in cold and muddy trenches. Despite the war reparations and new oversea possessions, it took France years to recover from wounds caused by war, but continuous labor movements encumbered it for a long time. By the end of 1919, the Chief of the General Staff decided that completing these ships would be too expansive for the fragile French economy. Four of them were cancelled in the 1922 construction program, and were laid up in the ship graveyard of Landevennec before being broken up in 1923-1926, while Béarn was officially converted to a carrier in 1927.\n\nFinancial problems forced the French Navy to reduce its battleship force. Lorraine and Provence were reduced to reserve status in 1922, and the latter went into drydock for a major overhaul. What's even worse, Jean Bart saw mutiny in 1919, and France was wrecked after striking an uncharted rock just two years later, casting a shadow on French Navy as 1922 closing in.\n\nAlthough the French government was not keen on another naval arms race which it couldn't afford, it responded negatively to the idea of reducing their capital ships' tonnage to 175,000 tons in the naval conference and demanded 350,000, slightly above the Japan's. In the end, concessions regarding cruisers and submarines helped persuade the French to agree to the limit on capital ships. Another issue that was considered critical by the French representatives was the Italian request of substantial parity; however, pressure from the American and the British delegations caused the French to accept it.\n\nNo matter how France thought negatively about terms of the treaty, the die is cast. For now its navy would first focus on securing its own domain."
 naval_lore_desc_1_ita: "The Regia Marina was established following the formation of the Kingdom of Italy. Just as the Kingdom was a unification of various states, so was the Regia Marina, though the main constituents were the navies of Sardinia and Naples. The new Navy inherited a substantial number of ships, and the long naval traditions of its constituents.\n\nAs the dreadnought race raging between the United Kingdom and Germany, Italy and Austria were in a race of their own for domination of the Adriatic Sea. Before 1914, Italy built six dreadnought battleships including Conte di Cavour- and Andrea Doria-class, while Austria answered with four Tegetthoff-class.\n\nDuring the war, the Regia Marina spent its minor efforts in the Adriatic Sea, opposing the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Allied forces mainly limited themselves to blockading the Austro-Hungarian navy inside the Adriatic with the Otranto Barrage, which was successful with regards to surface units, but failed for the submarines. Considered a relatively minor part of the naval warfare, the Regia Marina nonetheless tied down significant forces. For most of the war it avoided wherever possible the Austro-Hungarian navy, but still lost a handful of warships due to what was believed to be Austrian sabotage, which included the battleship Benedetto Brin and Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nIn late-war, Italy developed the MAS boats, that, by chance, managed to sink SMS Szent István on 10 June 1918; and a human torpedo carrying two men, which entered the harbour of Pola and planted two magnetic mines on 1 November 1918 which sank Austrian flagship SMS Viribus Unitis, with considerable loss of life.\n\nShortly after the war, the Italian government set about modernizing the Regia Marina to reach dominance over the Mediterranean Sea, and even take on the British Royal Navy. But this never came to reality in the face of the Washington Naval Treaty. Just two years before that, the lead ship of Francesco Caracciolo-class battleships was launched after a 4-year pause, but Italy would never have the chance to complete these ships.\n\nDespite thousands of lives lost in the Isonzo River Valley, Italy felt betrayed and abandoned in the Treaty of Versailles because its ambitions into the Balkan region and Alpes were never fulfilled. During the \"two red years\", there were numerous strikes, protests against rises in the cost of living, occupations of factories and land by industrial workers or agricultural laborers, and other types of clashes between socialists and business owners. The government tried to play the role of neutral mediator, which dissatisfied both sides. The political turmoils led to Benito Mussolini's National Fascist Party ascending to power in Italy. Witnessing the weakness in government, he then organized the \"March on Rome\" in 1922 and was appointed as the Prime Minister of Italy by King himself."
 naval_lore_desc_1_ger: "Rising from a naval race with the United Kingdom, Germany had rapidly grown into the second-strongest naval power in the world. Its first dreadnought, SMS Nassau, was quickly outdated, and the same fate also had the Helgoland-class. From 1910 to 1914, Germany slowly caught up with Britain in terms of dreadnoughts, having König-class as its first battleship with all turrets placed on the centerline. German battlecruiser emphasized defense over speed, this deviated from \"speed over defense\" theory invented by British. Though the war forced the focus of military production to lean towards the army, there were four Bayern-class battleships and three Derfflinger-class battlecruisers planned.\n\nThe Battle of Jutland in June 1916 developed into the largest naval battle between Germany and UK. The Kaiserliche Marine's High Seas Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer, fought the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet, led by Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. The engagement was a stand off, as the Germans were outmanoeuvred by the larger British fleet, but managed to escape and inflicted more damage to the British fleet than they received.\n\nDespite a tactical victory, Germany failed to break Royal Navy's blockade, encouraging General Ludendorff to propose reopening the unrestricted submarine warfare. Attempts by German U-boats to cut the supply lines between North America and Britain had resulted in the sinking of RMS Lusitania in 1915. Germany promised not to target passenger liners after the incident, but its relationship with US was already broken.\n\nThe year of 1917 witnessed the collapse of Russian Empire, which shone a short-lived light of hope for the German Empire. To force the Russian Provisional Government out of the war, German armed forces joined their effort in Operation Albion, pushing Russian troops out of the Baltic States. However, the optimism felt within German government was soon ended by overwhelming American forces arriving in Europe in late-1917. With peace deal signed with the Bolsheviks which finally put an end to the Eastern Front, Germany concentrated its strength in the west for the last push. The Kaiserschlacht made an unprecedented advance of 60km, but German troops would soon face a complete breakdown aganist Allies' mechanized offensive in August. In September, the Meuse-Argonne offensive led by French and American divisions took the fight further towards the Hindenburg Line. Germany had no choice but call for an armistice after a series of domestic revolutions.\n\nWith the Kaiser's abdication and fleeing of the country, Germany moved towards surrender. Half a year after the armistice, the Treaty of Versailles was signed and marked a formal end of the war. It required Germany to cede its eastern provinces to Poland, and Alsace-Lorraine to France. Germany's military production was placed under strict supervision, preventing it from building any weapons that can be used for an attack. The High Sea Fleet, once the imperial pride, was handed over to Britain and awaited its judgement at Scapa Flow.\n\nFinally on 21 June 1919, Von Reuter, commander of the fleet, ordered detained ships to be sunk, and all the glories established in the early 20th century together with it."
 naval_lore_desc_1_sov: "Formally established in 1696, the Imperial Russian Navy lasted until dissolved in the wake of the February Revolution of 1917. It developed from a smaller force that had existed prior to Tsar Peter the Great's founding of the modern Russian navy during the Second Azov campaign in 1696. It expanded in late 18th century and reached its peak strength by the early part of the 19th century, behind only the British and French fleets in terms of size.\n\nHowever, Russia's slow technical and economic development in the 19th century caused her to fall behind other European countries in the field of steamboat. The glory of her navy was crushed and humiliated after swallowing a bitter defeat in the Tsushima Strait during the Russo-Japanese War, making Russia the only European country that lost to an Asian one in a full-out war. At the end of the war, Russia fell from the third greatest naval power to sixth place. The focus of the Russian navy then shifted from the Far East to the Baltic, defending Petersburg from the German Empire.\n\nIn 1907, a naval expansion program was put before the Duma but voted down, yet the later Bosnian Crisis forced reconsideration. Facing an inevitable German-Austrian alliance, Russia felt threatened by Austria's bolder actions targeting Serbia, a close ally of Russia. Four Sevastopol-class battleships were laid down in 1909 to phase out the pre-dreadnoughts in the navy and guard the Gulf of Finland. Delivered before the war, their turrets and fire controls were barely finished in mid-1915. Meanwhile, three similarly designed Imperatritsa Mariya-class were built for the Black Sea Fleet in response to the worsening relationship with Ottoman. The rearmament program included a significant element of foreign participation with several ships (including the cruiser Rurik) and machinery ordered from foreign firms. After the outbreak of the Great War, ships and equipment being built in Germany were confiscated, and those from the United Kingdom was slow in reaching Russia or was diverted to the Western Allies' own war effort.\n\nIn the course of the war, Russian navy engaged Germany and Ottoman on two fronts. With the German fleet larger and more modern in the Baltic, the Russian navy played a defensive role, at most attacking German convoys and laying mines. The Black Sea was the domain of Russia with a large fleet based in Sevastopol, and it was led by two skilled commanders: Admiral Eberhart and Admiral Kolchak. The greatest loss suffered by the Black Sea fleet was the destruction of the battleship Imperatritsa Mariya, which blew up in port on 7 October 1916.\n\nEven though Russia in 1916 had the strength to launch the decisive Brusilov Offensive, it had already reached the breaking point when famines and countless coffins from the frontline frustrated every Russian. With people losing faith in the Tsar's regime, there were large-scale protests in the capital region, forcing the Tsar to abdicate. This is known as the February Revolution."
 naval_lore_desc_1_chi: "It is often said that the emperor of China ruled the country from the Forbidden City through papers but knew nothing about what happened in this vast empire, not to mention the world, although it is wrong.\n\nBack in the Ming Dynasty, China owned a large fleet that only Spanish Armada could match. In 1405, Yongle Emperor sponsored the massive and long term treasure voyages led by admiral Zheng He, decades earlier than the Age of Discovery. Besides Malay Archipelago, these expeditions even reached India, Arabia and East Africa. The Treasure Ship, flagship of Zheng's fleet, was deemed to be even bigger than typical ship of line in the west. However, the imperial sponsored voyages ended as soon as Yongle died, and China entered a period of coastal lockdown for centuries. The reason behind this was considered to be closely related to rampant piracy and smuggling in coastal regions, and it was taken to an even higher level during the Qing Dynasty to uphold Manchu Court's reign.\n\nBehind in all aspects of industrialization, Qing was shocked by the result of the Opium Wars, and realized the mighty power of guns and ships. In 1871, the Beiyang Fleet was created and sponsored by Li Hongzhang, one of the most trusted vassals of Empress Dowager Cixi and the principal patron of the \"self-strengthening movement\" in northern China. By 1890, it had become the largest of China's four regional navies.\n\nUnlike other Chinese fleets, the Beiyang Fleet consisted mostly of battleships imported from Germany and Great Britain. When the flagships Dingyuan and Zhenyuan were purchased from Germany, the superiority in strength of the Beiyang Fleet became evident, which the navy had 78 ships, with a total tonnage of 83,900 tons. Yet a sense of optimism spread in the imperial court, few people saw rising Japan as a true threat, so that the emperor cut funding to the military, instead putting money into domestic affairs and renovation of the luxurious New Summer Palace.\n\nDue to the lack of funding and training, the Beiyang Fleet, despite a paper strength, lost most of its ironclads in a naval battle against Combined Fleet during Sino-Japanese War, leading to Japanese forces successfully pushing Qing out of Korea. The remnants of the fleet, led by admiral Ding Ruchang, retreated to its base well protected by Krupp guns and mines in Weihaiwei. His desperate fight lasted 20 days before Japan sieged the port with overwhelming troops and sank more ships in night raids. Realizing that Qing's army was reluctant to help him out, Ding committed suicide and gave his last word to let his successor surrender.\n\nWith military forces totally crushed, Qing had no choice but submitted to Japan's conditions in the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan and its influence in Korea. As Qing shambled through wars and unequal treaties in early 20th century, it collapsed in the flame of Xinhai Revolution, ending China's monarchy lasting for two thousand years."
 naval_lore_desc_1_ast: "The Commonwealth Naval Forces were established on 1 March 1901, with the amalgamation of the six separate colonial naval forces, following the Federation of Australia. It initially consisted of the former New South Wales, Victorian, Queensland, Western Australian, South Australian and Tasmanian ships and resources of their disbanded navies. There were debates whether the naval force should be directly controlled by the British Admiralty, but a compromise was made that it should adopt a mixed role of local defense and forming a fleet unit within the Royal Navy. In 1911, it was officially titled the Royal Australian Navy by King George V.\n\nBy the outbreak of the Great War, 1914, the RAN consisted of 16 vessels, including the battlecruiser HMAS Australia and a squadron of light cruisers, and it saw several operations in Europe and Asia-Pacific. The 1914 Battle of Cocos marked the first naval victory in Australia's history, which ended with sinking of the German cruiser SMS Emden by HMAS Sydney. The fleet was then assigned to the European theatre as a branch of the Grand Fleet under direct control of the Admiralty. With HMAS Australia becoming the flagship of the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron, however, she missed the battle at Jutland due to a collision with her sister ship HMS New Zealand on the morning of 21 April 1916. The last years of the war saw a continuation of the battlecruiser's routine of exercises and patrols in the North Sea.\n\nWhen the armistice with Germany was signed, one of the conditions was that the German High Seas Fleet was to be interred at Scapa Flow. The German fleet crossed the North Sea, and on 21 November, the British Grand Fleet sailed out to meet it; Australia led the port division of the fleet. Australia then escorted the battlecruiser SMS Hindenburg to Scapa Flow, and was assigned as the German vessel's guardship. She subsequently formed part of the force which guarded the High Seas Fleet during late 1918 and early 1919, and spent much of her time either at anchor at Scapa Flow, or conducting patrols in the North Sea.\n\nBy war's end, over 60,000 Australians had died during the conflict, which left a deep scar on the dominion itself and its relationship with London. In the wake of the economic crisis immediately after the war, the RAN decided to reduce its size."

 naval_lore_desc_2_eng: "Immediately after the Great War, Britain still had the world's largest and most powerful navy, followed by the United States and more distantly by Japan, France and Italy, but her superiority was declining. With the United States and Japan advancing in fleet expansion ambitiously, the Royal Navy almost stagnated due to the empire's poor financial state.\n\nHowever, the uncertainty from another arms race made it unwelcome to the American public. The Congress disapproved of Wilson's 1919 naval expansion plan, causing politics to resume the non-interventionalism of the prewar era. Despite the greatest competitor, the US still found common interests with Britain in keeping balance of power on the sea. In late 1921, the Washington Naval Conference was held between the five most powerful naval countries in this situation.\n\nAs restrictions were imposed upon battleships, the naval powers entered a period of \"holiday\", which not a single capital ship was laid. With G3 and N3 projects cancelled, however, the Royal Navy managed to finish HMS Hood, one of the most advanced ships then. Many battleships built before the Great War, as demanded by treaty, were dismantled or disarmed, leaving other capital ships still in service but rapidly aging. In 1922, two Nelson-class built under the treaty, known as the Big Sevens, became Britain's last effort before entering the naval holiday.\n\nRefits were undergoing simultaneously on obsolete battleships and battlecruisers. Queen Elizabeth-class received large-scale modernisation throughout the late 1920s and 1930s, with a new block superstructure for the bridge, while Revenge-class and Renown-class were reinforced with more anti-air guns.\n\nEven though the battleship production was paused, Britain found breakthroughs in its carrier forces. Britain once pioneered in naval aviation by the conversion of liner Conte Rosso in 1918, which gave birth to the first aircraft carrier with full-length flight deck in human history, the HMS Argus. Since then, it had again experimented on HMS Hermes and HMS Eagle, and they were later followed by the reconstruction of Courageous-class in the 1920s. By 1936, the Royal Navy possessed a fleet of five carriers of different sizes, with a new generation of armored carrier, HMS Ark Royal, still under construction.\n\nTo guard its vast colonial empire, Britain developed several classes of light-armored but flexible cruisers in the 1920s. Despite lacking protection, these cruisers, including County- and Leander-class, were designed to be deployed at every key point along Britain's trade routes, forming the empire's most trustworthy escorts together with new destroyers.\n\nAs the world steadily moving towards 1940, it seemed nothing could go wrong for the British Empire. However, with rumors that Japan and Italy were trying to pull away from the naval treaty, it cast a shadow over the crumbling Versailles System. For the time being, the Royal Navy still rules the waves, but there is no time to waste for a rearmament. "
 naval_lore_desc_2_usa: "Demanded by the treaty, all American capital ships laid after 1920 were cancelled and scrapped, which also included USS Washington laid earlier. Several obsolete dreadnoughts were disarmed and turned into training ships, leaving the US with around a dozen heavily armored but extremely slow battleships.\n\nThis was not all in vain, the aircraft carriers USS Saratoga and USS Lexington were built on the hulls of partially built battlecruisers, which largely strengthened America's naval aviation forces. In fact, the US research on naval aviation dated back to 1910 when civilian pilot Eugene Ely took off from USS Birmingham in a Curtiss Model D. In 1920, the collier Jupiter was installed with a full-length flight deck and named USS Langley, and it was recognized by many to be the starting point of US carriers.\n\nIn the next decade, even though the United States thrived during the Roaring Twenties, the navy did not get huge investments. Instead it mainly focused on renovating old battleships and destroyers. The late 1920s witnessed America's attempt to build modern cruisers, this was represented by its first treaty cruiser, the Pensacola-class, and was followed by more standardized Northampton- and Portland-class. But its shipbuilding effort was soon faced with a major blow, the Great Depression.\n\nBelieved by many to be caused by overcapacity, the reason of Great Depression could be more complicated. Irregulated expansion of capitalism, excessive issuance of consumer loans and gold standard were all considered to be a part of what caused this global disaster. What started as a stock market crash quickly became an endless loop of hell for the country under President Hoover's disastrous policies, leaving millions of American people in poverty and companies in bankruptcy.\n\nAs soon as President Franklin Roosevelt was inaugurated in 1933, he was left with an America torn not only in economy but also in society. The New Deal put a lot emphasis on relieving labors, while Roosevelt, once the second chief in the Navy Department during the Great War, also gave full support to the navy. The Public Works Administration diverted plenty of resources and workers for the naval expansion, achieving the launch of Yorktown-class carriers.\n\nThe USN never stopped experiments on new tactics. A series of exercises, known as the Fleet Problem, were held extensively during the interwar period. Their scale shrank under Hoover's administration, but back to normal after Roosevelt took over. In return, senior leaders were eager for innovation and new technologies. They even developed a strategy called War Plan Orange for victory in the Pacific in a hypothetical war with Japan.\n\nAlthough the New Deal has achieved initial success, the recovery of America's economy still has a long way to go. As the storm gathering on the horizon, it is more obvious that wars are coming to Europe and Asia once again like 1914. The United States, staying neutral for now, is the last stronghold of peace and freedom in these uncertain times, or is it?"
 naval_lore_desc_2_jap: "Taking the US as the greatest threat to its hegemony, Japan devoted to improve its fleet to overcome that. United on the surface, the debate over supremacy of battleship or carrier was heated among admirals, while another debate on whether to remain in the Washington System headed by Katō Tomosaburō and Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu was also intense within the Combined Fleet.\n\nThere was one thing for sure, Japan was too weak to fight a symmetric war against US on the Pacific, and its only way is to lure American fleets into a trap and consume them as many as possible before Japan's battleships can overwhelm them in one combat. This is known as the \"Decisive Battle\" theory, which profoundly influenced Japan's ship designs and doctrine throughout the interwar period.\n\nIn the 1920s, most of ships underwent extensive refit, including the armoring of Kongo-class and engine modifications on Nagato-class. Realizing the inferiority, Japanese naval architects tended to mount more armor and firepower on a single ship. It came to fruition as the Special-Type destroyers. Displacing 1,750 tons, the Special-Types were way larger than typical destroyers built before 1930, with even more firepower, and were later equipped with the infamous Type-93 oxygen torpedo. The Type-93, also known as the Long Lance, also saw service on cruisers such as Myoko and Takao. However, excessive emphasis on the armaments led to poor stability. The Tomozure Incident and later Fourth Fleet Incident all pointed to flaws in the design, leading to much more time wasted in improving the seaworthiness of ships.\n\nIn response to the London Naval Conference, Japan started a series of naval construction programs to strengthen its cruiser forces. These plans were known as the Maru Keikaku (Fleet Replenishment Plan, or literally Circle Plan), and would begin in 1931, 1934, 1937 and 1939, in an attempt to catch up with the US. The first plan was centered around Mogami-class cruisers, which were the largest light cruisers ever built within the restriction, and it provoked US to respond with the Brooklyn-class. The second plan focused on expanding Japan's carrier forces, with two carriers, Soryu and Hiryu, planned.\n\nAs the start date of the Third Maru Keikaku nearing, many high-ranking officers and officials believed that Japan would withdraw from the on-going Second London Conference. Within IJN, the evaluation of a class of super battleships was secretly underway. Shadowing all the battleships built before, it would mount nine 460mm guns, which would be the largest naval guns ever invented. Japan has dedicated everything to defeat the United States in a future conflict, but no one in IJN was confident enough to claim an obvious victory.\n\nWith political turmoils and Sino-Japanese relationship reaching another breaking point ever since 1895, Japan seemed like a train without a brake, heading towards the abyss of war. As the military growing bolder by its invasion of China, concerns from the western powers applying trade sanctions brought Japan with a fear of being cut off from the world. No matter how, Japan must take action before it's too late."
 naval_lore_desc_2_fra: "To maintain her position of a major naval power, France would have to follow the other four major naval powers with her own treaty cruiser. The earliest was the 8,000 ton Duguay Trouin-class, which was authorized under the 1924 build program, sacrificing protection for speed. Together with Duquesne-class, they were the first major French warships built after the Great War and proved successful. Built based on Duquesne, the subsequent Suffren-class further improved their armor while retaining the same armament.\n\nMeanwhile, even more efforts were made on large destroyers. Preliminary studies by the Naval General Staff (NGS) began before Great War, but were suspended when the war began. They resumed when the NGS decided to split the role of the destroyer in 1919. The smaller torpilleur d'escadre would have the role of attacking the enemy's battleline with torpedoes, while the larger contre-torpilleur was for scouting. This required high speed in all weather, good endurance and a powerful armament capable of engaging small cruisers.\n\nThe first attempt would be the Chacal-class, and was followed by similar Guepard-, Aigle-, and Vauquelin-class in the early 1930s. The ultimate form of large destroyer finally evolved into a serious competitor of light cruiser, which was represented by Le Fantasque-class. Powered by two Rateau-Breguet turbines, each of the ships greatly exceeded their designed speed in sea trials, ranging from 41.4 to 45.1 knots. In 1930, Émile Bertin was laid and became the basis for later light and heavy cruisers, particularly the La Galissonnière-class. Heavy cruiser Algérie was ordered at the same time, and turned out to be the last treaty cruiser built by France.\n\nFrench battleship studies initially focused on countering fast Italian cruisers, leading to early designs for small, relatively lightly protected capital ships. But the advent of Deutschland-class cruisers proved to be more threatening to French interests, prompting the need for larger vessels. The resulting design of Dunkerque-class produced a small battleship armed with eight 330mm guns in two quadruple turrets forward. In response to Italy's Littorio-class battleships laid in the previous year, France ordered two fast battleships in 1935. The Richelieu-class scaled up to accommodate 380mm guns and heavier armor. To keep the ships within the displacement limits, they featured the same concentrated layout for the main battery, but they were still a little surpassing the restrictions.\n\nDespite being behind the UK, US and Japan, the French Navy still kept its lineage inherited from the imperial times, and it would still be an important branch of the Third Republic's military forces in the 1930s. However, fear about another Franco-German conflict has reached such a pitch. Different thoughts about war or peace has greatly torn French society apart, and it remains a question whether the French people have the confidence about winning another war."
 naval_lore_desc_2_ita: "In 1923, the British response to the Corfu incident left Benito Mussolini and his military advisors convinced that Italy was \"imprisoned in the Mediterranean\" through British bases in Gibraltar, the Suez Canal, Malta, and Cyprus. During the interwar period, the Regia Marina chose to build fast ships armed with longer ranged guns to give the Italian vessels the ability to minimize close contact with vessels of the Royal Navy, whose crews were more experienced. New guns were developed with longer ranges than their British counterparts. Speed was emphasized in their new construction.\n\nIn the early 1920s, the Regia Marina began design studies for cruisers that would adhere to the limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty. In 1924, the French Navy laid down the first of two Duquesne-class cruisers, prompting the Regia Marina to order two Trento-class to match their rival. The designers emphasized very high speed, which required a significant reduction in armor protection. When the French started to produce the Le Fantasque-class destroyers that were superior in firepower to other destroyers, it convinced Italy to respond with the Condottieri-type cruisers that would be of intermediate size between the new French destroyers and cruisers.  Among them, Giussano- and Cadorna-class were almost the same while the later Montecuccoli had significantly better protection, with similar enhancement also seen on Zara-class.\n\nMeanwhile, modernisation on the four obsolete battleships including Conte di Cavour and Andrea Doria turned into a significant reconstruction project, with only 40% of the original structures being left. Their guns were upgraded, going from thirteen 305mm guns to ten 320mm guns, and the coal-fired boilers were replaced with modern oil-fired boilers. These works lasted for several years and has not finished yet in 1936.\n\nThe Regia Marina, witnessing the success of French large destroyers, devoted more resources to develop destroyers with similar size. While the initial post-war destroyers had a standard displacement of around 1,000 tons, the Navigatori-class built in 1928 raised this number to 1,900 tons, which was very close to the French Chacal-class. However, the following Freccia- and Folgore-class didn't continue this trend due to an unsuccessful attempt to reduce their beams to achieve higher speed. The lessons learned would be vital to the construction of the next generation of destroyers, represented by the Oriani-class.\n\nBy 1930, France laid down two Dunkerque-class battleships armed with eight 330mm guns. In late 1932, Italian constructors responded with a design similar to the Deutschland class, but the navy decided that a larger design should be pursued. The resulting Littorio-class had two ships planned initially, with Littorio and Vittorio Veneto being laid in 1934. However, due to rising tensions around the world, the navy feared that only two Littorios would not be enough to counter the British and French Mediterranean Fleets. In December 1935, Admiral Domenico Cavagnari proposed that two more battleships (Roma and Impero) should be built to counter a possible Franco-British alliance. But Mussolini postponed his decision.\n\nWith invasion of Ethiopia, Italy is gradually breaking peace and stability of the world, which is met with warm welcome from Germany, another revanchist state eager to take back what was lost in the war 20 years ago. It's still unclear what kind of role the Regia Marina will play in these uncertain times."
 naval_lore_desc_2_ger: "Upon dissolution of the German Empire, the Weimar Republic was established on the ruins of war. In its initial years, grave problems beset the Republic, such as hyperinflation and political extremism, including political murders and two attempted seizures of power by contending paramilitaries; internationally, it suffered isolation, reduced diplomatic standing and contentious relationships with the great powers.\n\nUnder the terms of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, Germany was only allowed a minimal navy of 15,000 personnel, six capital ships of no more than 10,000 tons, six cruisers, twelve destroyers, twelve torpedo boats and no submarines or aircraft carriers. Germany could only build new ships to replace old ones. All the ships allowed and personnel were taken over from the Kaiserliche Marine, which was renamed the Reichsmarine.\n\nFrom the outset, Germany worked to circumvent the military restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles. The Germans continued to develop U-boats through a submarine design office in the Netherlands and a torpedo research program in Sweden where the G7e torpedo was developed. In the late 1920s, three Königsberg- and two Lepzig-class cruisers were built, becoming the most modernised ships of the Reichsmarine. They were extensively used as training ships in the 1930s, with training cruiser Emden which was based on Great-war designs.\n\nThe launching of the first pocket battleship, Deutschland in 1931 was a step in the formation of a modern German fleet, which caused consternation among the French and the British. By using innovative construction techniques, the Germans had built a heavy ship suitable for offensive warfare on the high seas while still abiding by the letter of the treaty. The subsequent ships of the class, Admiral Scheer and Graf Spee, were laid in 1931 and 1932 respectively.\n\nWhen the Nazis came to power in 1933, Adolf Hitler soon began to more brazenly ignore many of the Treaty restrictions and accelerated German naval rearmament. It met warm welcome from senior naval officers such as Erich Raeder, who became the commander-in-chief of the Kriegsmarine in 1935. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935 allowed Germany to build a navy equivalent to 35% of the British surface ship tonnage and 45% of British submarine tonnage; battleships were to be limited to no more than 35,000 tons. That same year the Reichsmarine was renamed as the Kriegsmarine, indicating Hitler's ambition to free Germany from restrictions.\n\nFor years, the Nazis has imposed an extreme nationalism and racism upon people by blaming Jewish Germans for all the economic failures, transforming Germany into a huge barracks full of hatred and revanchism. When the Italian invasion of Ethiopia led to only mild protests by the British and French governments, it was more obvious that Britain and France would \"tolerate\" Germany's offensive actions to some extent. Would Germany and her people suppress their passion with reason, or submit to the Führer and the illusory revival of Aryan race?"
 naval_lore_desc_2_sov: "The high hopes felt across Russia following the February Revolution had diminished to almost nothing by the closing weeks of 1917. The Provisional Government's ineffectual policies and weak authority in the face of the Petrograd Soviet had left the capital paralyzed with incessant street fighting and political turmoil. An attempted \"March on Petrograd\" by General Lavr Kornilov in August had demonstrated the army's willingness to restore order, but President Alexander Kerensky had instead made the disastrous mistake of freeing the Bolsheviks to protect the city.\n\nDespite the conspiracy that Germany was behind the return of Vladimir Lenin, communism became quite popular among workers and soldiers, and finally led to the October Revolution and the brutal Russian Civil War. Most sailors sided with the Bolsheviks, and their ships remained in port due to shortage of fuel. With the communists controlling key industrial regions, the anti-Bolsheviks factions formed the White Army, but they were never united as a whole and were weak compared to the Red Army. Against all odds, the Soviet Union was established and survived foreign interventions, becoming the flagship communist state as a federation of a few national republics.\n\nIt took Soviet several years to recover from the devastating civil war and later famines. In 1928, the first Five-year Plan marked the start of Soviet's industrialisation, it greatly improved the status of civilian industry by expanding factories, infrastructure, powerplants and so on. During the 1930s, plans were made to expand the Red Navy into one of the most powerful in the world. Approved by the Labour and Defence Council in 1926, the Naval Shipbuilding Program included plans to build over 100 submarines in the next few years. The Soviet also tried to finish some light cruisers, including Svetlana- and Admiral Nakhimov-class, built during imperial era.\n\nInspired by French large destroyers, the Red Navy designed Leningrad-class destroyers in the 1930s. They were ordered in two batches of three ships each; the first group was designated Project 1 and the second Project 38. These ships were the first large vessels designed and built by the Soviets after the October Revolution of 1917.\n\nAdditional developments included the formation of the Pacific Fleet in 1932 and the Northern Fleet in 1933, but both were relatively weak in terms of ships compared to the Baltic Fleet and Black Sea Fleet. There were also plans to build more powerful Sovetsky Soyuz-class battleships, which the two newly founded fleets would be centered around them.\n\nIn 1936, despite a strong presence in the Baltic and the Black Sea, the Red Navy had few ships in the Barents and Pacific region. Even though the heavy industry was thriving, it would still take years before Russia gets back to its original place."
 naval_lore_desc_2_chi: "Following the overthrow of Qing after Xinhai Revolution in 1911, the rebels established a republican Provisional Government in Nanjing headed by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, which only controlled half of China. While the north was still in the hand of Yuan Shikai, commander-in-chief of Beiyang Army and former Qing's military forces. A compromise was made between Sun and Yuan in 1912 to facilitate the unification of China by appointing the latter as president. However, Yuan took a step further and claimed himself the emperor of China, sparking the National Protection War, which ended halfway as he died in 1916 and left a fractured republic in his wake.\n\nDuring the era of warloadism, China was torn apart by endless civil war. As winner of the Great War, it did not bring China any good but the loss of German interests in Shandong to Japan. When Zhili and Fengtian were fighting for dominance over Beijing, Sun and his Kuomintang bided their time in the south. But Sun's cause was hindered by his death in 1925, leaving the temporary alliance with communists crumbling under Chiang Kai-shek. The Northern Expedition in 1926 was launched to crush warlords and bring China back to unity. Although Chiang forced the demise of Beiyang Government, the country remained de facto divided into realms controlled by military leaders, including Feng Yuxiang, Yan Xishan, Zhang Xueliang and local warlords in southwest China.\n\nThe ROCN pledged their loyalty to Kuomintang in the Northern Expedition and later civil war with Communist Party. ROCN was outdated, with its largest ship being Haiqi, a protected cruiser built during the imperial era. It was not until the 1930s that the first modern ship of China, Ninghai, was commissioned to be the flagship. Designed by Japanese naval architects, Ninghai and her sister Pinghai received six 140mm guns and four torpedo tubes.\n\nROCN had four battle fleets. The first and second fleet established by officers of Fujian Clique had most of ships, and was loyal to Chiang's central government. The third fleet was organized upon Fengtian's navy after the Northeast Flag Replacement, and has been China's largest fleet until three of its cruisers defected to Guangdong in 1933 after Xuejiadao Incident, with Haiqi and Haichen returned to the third fleet in 1935.\n\nIn 1931, the September 18 Incident (Mukden Incident) broke out between Fengtian and Japan's Kwantung Army, but ended up with Zhang Xueliang's troops standing down under Chiang's order. His weakness encouraged Japan to plot another strike on Chinese garrisons in Shanghai, 1932, leading to the demilitarization of the city. Carried out by junior officers in army or navy, these bold actions met little opposition within Japan's military. Inukai Tsuyoshi and his cabinet has taken all measures to stop the military from getting out of control, but only to find that the last glimmer of Taisho Democracy vanished after the disastrous May 15 Incident.\n\nWith military consolidating power in Japan, it seemed that a war has become inevitable. As most Chinese people realizing the urgency of resisting Japan's invasion, Chiang still insisted his anti-communist civil war and refused to form a united front with CPC headed by Mao Zedong. China in 1936 is a sleeping tiger, but perhaps only a punch can wake him up."
 naval_lore_desc_2_ast: "The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty had marked a turning point in Australia's defence policy. With it, the threat from a rising Japan was eliminated when its fleet expansion programs were put to an end, making it unable to further interfere with affairs in South Pacific. Despite that, the treaty requested disarmament of Australian navy since its tonnage was contributed to the share of Britain.\n\nThis led to HMAS Australia being one of the battlecruisers waiting for disposal to meet restrictions posed on the Royal Navy. Facing the dilemma that the Admiralty refused to support maintenance of the ship and its guns, the Australian authority has also lost their interest in it. Australian Naval Command tried to bargin a better term with the Admiralty to use the battlecruiser as Royal Navy's target ship in an attempt to relieve the finicial state, but was rejected. The scuttling was originally scheduled for Anzac Day, but was brought forward to 12 April, so the visiting British Special Service Squadron could participate. The sinking of Australia marked its navy's entry of a period of decline.\n\nIn the 1920s, the Royal Australian Navy ordered several new vessels from Britain, including two heavy cruisers, HMAS Australia and HMAS Canberra. They were designed as evquivalents to Britain's Kent, the first batch of County class cruisers. Other than that, the RAN decommissioned some obsolete ships and kept its size affordable during the Great Depression.\n\nAs Japan trying to deviate from the limitation set by the naval treaty in the 1930s, the RAN found itself in an increasingly difficult situation. Although it still maintained a decent fleet in Asia-Pacific, Australia clearly couldn't remain unaffected on its own in the looming tensions when London's promise to offer naval protection to the Far East became infirm day after day."
