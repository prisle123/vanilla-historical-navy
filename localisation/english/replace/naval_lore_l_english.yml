The 20th century witnessed the rise of naval powers, and the navy has been playing a vital role in global strategy.\n\nEver since the Anglo-German Naval Arms Race, navies of the world have been innovating and expanding their fleet. From wolfpacks beneath the sea to behemoths on the surface, modernized warships dominates every inch of the waters."

 naval_lore_desc_1_eng: "Possessing the largest navy in the Victorian Era, the United Kingdom has always been the strongest naval power since the mid-19th century, and led the naval development through its unparalleled technologies.\n\nIn the 1900s, Europe was on the brink of war when Germany's ambition to pursue a place in the sun threatened old colonial empires. The Royal Navy got unprecedented investments against expanding German forces. The launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1905 started the naval evolution, whose uniform caliber marked the advent of central fire control and changed the rule of naval combat. Other powers developed their dreadnoughts in merely four years. The United Kingdom, however, answered with four classes of dreadnoughts including St. Vincent- and Bellerophon-class. With superfire structure achieved on HMS Orion, it outdated all dreadnoughts built before 1909. The King George V- and Iron Duke-class also followed such layout.\n\nInspired by HMS Invincible, battlecruiser that trades defense for speed was invented. Launched before the war, the Queen Elizabeth-class also embraced the superiority of speed as fast battleships, with seven economical but slower Revenge-class (two were refitted as Renown-class) ordered to ensure predominance.\n\nThe Battle of Jutland saw the failure of British battlecruisers and profoundly changed the designing of battleships. The lessons learned would be vital to the development of long-range guns and fire control systems. Although Royal Navy stood unchallenged on the sea, the cracks were to appear on the land. With Russian Empire collapsing into a civil war, the Entente was in desperate need of support from the New World, while the Zimmermann Telegram offered a perfect chance for American intervention.\n\nWith overwhelming American forces joined Allies offensive in mid-1917, it quickly forced the German Empire to pull back from French territory in merely a year. When the Treaty of Versailles was signed, UK secured its world dominance and grabbed most of German possessions in Africa and Asia-Pacific.\n\nOld rival falls, new rival rises. As the Kaiserliche Marine, the greatest enemy, scuttled its fleet at Scapa Flow, the Royal Navy was at a crossroad where its dominance established centuries ago was chanllenged by the United States Navy and Imperial Japanese Navy. Following the fact that the army seized to expand post-war, major navies of the world proceeded the new generation of battleships designed during the Great War. Nevertheless, Britain only had one Admiral-class under construction, and estimates by the Admiralty were that by the early 1920s, the Royal Navy would be behind in ships.\n\nThe original plan was to build three battleships and one battlecruiser in 1921, and again in 1922, but this was then changed to four G3-class battlecruisers to be built first, presumably to be followed by the same number of battleships (potentially N3-class) in the following year. However, these plans were soon cancelled upon the Washington Naval Treaty."
 naval_lore_desc_1_usa: "In 1890, The Influence of Seapower Upon History by Alfred Mahan was published. It discussed the various factors needed to support and achieve sea power, with emphasis on having the largest and most powerful fleet. For the United States, the theory justified investments in the navy, allowing expansionism to gaze at farther frontiers from the Caribbean to the Pacific.\n\nThe election of Theodore Roosevelt in 1901 was considered a milestone to the US Navy. Influenced by the Russo-Japanese War and the launch of HMS Dreadnought, he gave the greenlight to the naval expansion and organized the global tour of Great White Fleet in 1907. By 1912, another eight dreadnoughts had been built including Florida- and Wyoming-class, with 14-inch guns first applied to New York-class in 1914.\n\nThe United States kept its neutrality in the early stage of the war, making plenty of funds for its navy. It came to fruition as Nevada-class, the first standard-type battleship, and innovations such as triple-mounted guns and all-or-nothing armor scheme. Another two Pennsylvania-class that completely adopted triple batteries were laid just three months later. However, the increasing funding of the navy met opposition from Senator Benjamin Tillman, who asked to build maximum battleships to end the naval race once and for all, but his proposal was never considered seriously.\n\nPlanned before the Battle of Jutland, the designs of New Mexico- and Tennessee-class were already outdated in 1916, but the General Board's appeal to equip them with heavier armor was shot down by Secretary of Navy, Josephus Daniels, who insisted on standardization. Only their torpedo bulkheads and elevation of guns were improved.\n\nWhen the United States joined the war on the Allies' side in 1917, there was no fight left on the sea because German stationed most of its ships in fortified ports, and this continued until the end of the war. But the USN still played a role in protecting and shipping hundreds of thousands of soldiers and marines of the American Expeditionary Force and war supplies across the Atlantic in U-boat infested waters.\n\nStarting from this point, the strength of USN grew under an ambitious naval expansion program, the Naval Act of 1916, or Big Navy Act. The program first funded the construction of four Colorado-class battleships in 1917, America's first attempt to apply 16-inch guns, and another six Lexington-class battlecruisers with similar firepower but lighter armor. Together with the Lexingtons, six South Dakota-class battleships were ordered in 1920, being slightly faster than Colorado and mounted more guns.\n\nHowever, none of these ships, except for the Colorados, could come to reality because of the Washington Naval Treaty signed in 1922."
 naval_lore_desc_1_jap: "By the beginning of Sino-Japanese War, Japan had already built up considerable naval power with imported battleships. Victories over Qing and Russia at the turn of the 20th century marked a new dawn in Japan's regional hegemony and a rapid growth of its navy. Being the only nation in Asia with a significant naval presence, Japan fought alongside the United Kingdom and occupied most German possessions in the Pacific upon the start of the Great War.\n\nWithout a nearby battlefront, Japanese resources were diverted to naval construction. Once dwarfed by European, Japanese Navy had taken a leap since the commission of Kongo-class which first adopted uniform caliber used on dreadnoughts. Laid in 1912, the Fuso-class became its first effort to build dreadnoughts of western standard even with the flawed multi-turret design, and two Ise-class with revised layout were built three years later.\n\nUpon that, the Eight-Eight Fleet initiative was proposed by Naval General Staff to fund another four battleships in the following years. It started with two Nagato-class armed with eight 410mm guns in 1917, while two Tosa-class with an additional twin 410mm battery were ordered in 1920. Both can sail at 26kn despite tonnage raise. Alongside them were four Amagi-class battlecruisers planned. A few squadrons of Kamikaze- and Mutsuki-class destroyers were then built to counter the threat from the United States Navy.\n\nHowever, Japan's attempt to catch up with the first-line naval powers was ended in 1921 by Washington Naval Treaty, which asked Japan to cancel and scrap all the building plans beyond Nagato, even though Mutsu has been commissioned before the conference. This was unacceptable to the Japanese delegation and they agreed to keep Mutsu in exchange for scrapping the obsolete dreadnought Settsu, while also allowing the US to keep Colorado-class battleships which were fitting out.\n\nUnlike battleships, the aircraft carrier was not heavily restricted at that time, which encouraged multiple navies in the world to convert uncompleted battleship designs to carriers. Japan's effort would be Kaga, Amagi and Akagi, with Amagi severely damaged in the 1923 Kanto Earthquake and turned out to be unrepairable. Nevertheless, Japan's test on carrier happened way before this. It began in 1912 with the establishment of the Commission on Naval Aeronautical Research, several seaplane carriers were converted from other vessels. The experience would be crucial in the design of Hosho, the first to be built from the keel up as an aircraft carrier.\n\nDespite a considerable presence in the Pacific, IJN was inferior to American naval forces based in this region, this was made even worse after 1922 when the US concentrated all its battleships to Battle Fleet as the Pacific presence."
 naval_lore_desc_1_fra: "Founded in the 17th century, the French Navy was one of the oldest navies still in continual service, with precursors dating back to the Middle Ages. It has taken part in key events in history including the Napoleonic War and Weltkrieg, and played an important role in establishing and securing the French colonial empire for 400 years. The French Navy pioneered several innovations in naval technologies, such as the first ironclad and first mechanically propelled submarine.\n\nHowever, the development of French Navy slowed down when naval races between the United Kingdom and Germany grew in intensity. It entered the 20th century with only a dozen of pre-dreadnoughts in service. It was not until 1910 that four Courbet-class dreadnoughts were laid, which were characterized by longer but thinner waterline belt against underwater hits. In 1912, three Bretagne-class were ordered. They were an improvement of the previous Courbet-class and mounted ten 340mm guns instead of twelve 305mm guns as on the Courbets, which only saw limited service in the war. They were followed by five Normandie-class in 1913, the only warships to adopt quadruple batteries at that time.\n\nFrance entered the war with relatively few modern vessels, and naval production was hampered as the main French effort was on land. While Royal Navy held the North Sea, the French Navy was active in the Mediterranean, where they mostly kept watch on the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Once Italy entered the war on the Allied side in May 1915, the French Navy moved to more forward bases at Brindisi on the Italian Adriatic coast and the Greek island of Corfu. From there, it launched an amphibious invasion on Athens in 1916, forcing the pro-German Greek government to side with the Entente. French destroyer squadrons also played an important role in countering Germany's U-boat campaign by regularly patrolling the seas and escorting convoys.\n\nWhen the Treaty of Versailles was signed, France has lost a generation of brave young men in cold and muddy trenches. Despite the war reparations and new oversea possessions, it took France years to recover from wounds caused by war, but continuous labor movements encumbered it for a long time. By the end of 1919, the Chief of the General Staff decided that completing these ships would be too expansive for the fragile French economy. The first four of them were cancelled in the 1922 construction program, while Béarn was temporarily installed with a wooden flight deck, and was officially converted to a carrier in 1927.\n\nFinancial problems forced the French Navy to reduce its battleship force to four active vessels. Lorraine and Provence were reduced to reserve status in 1922, and the latter went into drydock for a major overhaul. What's even worse, Jean Bart saw mutiny in 1919, and France was wrecked after striking an uncharted rock in Quiberon Bay and foundered with three deaths just two years later, which cast a shadow on French Navy as 1922 closing in.\n\nAlthough the French government was not keen on another naval arms race which it couldn't afford, the French delegation responded negatively to the idea of reducing their capital ships' tonnage to 175,000 tons in the naval conference and demanded 350,000, slightly above the Japanese limit. In the end, concessions regarding cruisers and submarines helped persuade the French to agree to the limit on capital ships. Another issue that was considered critical by the French representatives was the Italian request of substantial parity, which was considered to be unsubstantiated; however, pressure from the American and the British delegations caused the French to accept it.\n\nNo matter how France thought negatively about terms of the treaty, the die is cast. For now its navy would first focus on securing its own domain."
 naval_lore_desc_1_ita: "The Regia Marina was established following the proclamation of the formation of the Kingdom of Italy. Just as the Kingdom was a unification of various states in the Italian peninsula, so the Regia Marina was formed from the navies of those states, though the main constituents were the navies of the former kingdoms of Sardinia and Naples. The new Navy inherited a substantial number of ships, both sail- and steam-powered, and the long naval traditions of its constituents.\n\nAs the dreadnought race raging between the United Kingdom and Germany, Austria and Italy were in a race of their own for domination of the Adriatic Sea. Before 1914, Italy built six dreadnought battleships including Conte di Cavour- and Andrea Doria-class, while Austria answered with four Tegetthoff-class.\n\nDuring the war, the Regia Marina spent its minor efforts in the Adriatic Sea, opposing the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The resulting Adriatic Campaign consisted mainly of Austro-Hungarian coastal bombardments of Italy's Adriatic coast, and wider-ranging German/Austro-Hungarian submarine warfare into the Mediterranean. Allied forces mainly limited themselves to blockading the Austro-Hungarian navy inside the Adriatic with the Otranto Barrage, which was successful with regards to surface units, but failed for the submarines. Considered a relatively minor part of the naval warfare, it nonetheless tied down significant forces. For most of the war the Regia Marina avoided wherever possible the Austro-Hungarian navy, but still lost a handful of warships due to combats or what was believed to be Austrian sabotage, which included the battleship Benedetto Brin and Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nIn the last part of the war, the Regia Marina developed the MAS boats, that, by chance, managed to sink the Austro-Hungarian battleship SMS Szent István in the Adriatic Sea on 10 June 1918; and an early type of human torpedo carrying two men, which entered the harbour of Pola and planted two magnetic mines on 1 November 1918 which exploded sinking the Austro-Hungarian flagship SMS Viribus Unitis, with considerable loss of life. SMS Tegetthoff was handed over to Italy as a war prize in 1919.\n\nShortly after the war, the Italian government set about modernizing the Regia Marina to reach dominance over the Mediterranean Sea, and even take on the British Royal Navy. But this never came to reality in the face of the Washington Naval Treaty. Just two years before that, the lead ship of Francesco Caracciolo-class battleships was launched after a 4-year pause, but Italy would never have the chance to complete these ships.\n\nDespite thousands of lives lost in the Isonzo River Valley, Italy felt betrayed and abandoned in the Treaty of Versailles because its ambitions into the Balkan region and Alpes were never fulfilled. During the \"two red years\", there were numerous strikes, protests against rises in the cost of living, occupations of factories and land by industrial workers or agricultural laborers, and other types of clashes between socialists and business owners. The government tried to play the role of neutral mediator, which dissatisfied both sides.\n\nThe political turmoils led to Benito Mussolini's National Fascist Party ascending to power in Italy. Witnessing the weakness in government, he then organized the \"March on Rome\" in 1922 and was appointed as the Prime Minister of Italy by King himself."

 naval_lore_desc_2_eng: "Immediately after the Great War, Britain still had the world's largest and most powerful navy, followed by the United States and more distantly by Japan, France and Italy, but her superiority was declining. With the United States and Japan advancing in fleet expansion ambitiously, the Royal Navy almost stagnated due to the empire's poor financial state.\n\nHowever, the uncertainty from another arms race made it unwelcome to the American public. The Congress disapproved of Wilson's 1919 naval expansion plan, and the 1920 presidential election campaign caused politics to resume the non-interventionalism of the prewar era, with little enthusiasm for continued naval expansion. Depite being the greatest competitor, the US still found that it shared the same interests with Britain in keeping balance of power on the sea. In late 1921, both sides were aware of the other's plan of a conference to discuss a global disarmament. The Washington Naval Conference was held between the five most powerful naval countries in this situation.\n\nAs restrictions were imposed upon battleships and other secondary ships, the naval powers entered a period of \"holiday\", which not a single capital ship was laid. With G3 and N3 projects cancelled, however, the Royal Navy managed to finish HMS Hood as its only capital ship in the 1920s, also one of the most advanced ships then. Quite a few battleships built before the Great War, as demanded by treaty, were dismantled or disarmed, leaving other capital ships still in active service but rapidly aging. In 1922, the two Nelson-class, known as the Big Sevens with their 16-inch guns, built under the terms of the naval treaty became Britain's last effort before entering the naval holiday.\n\nReconstruction and refit were undergoing simultaneously on obsolete battleships and battlecruisers. Queen Elizabeth-class received large-scale modernisation throughout the late 1920s and 1930s, with new block superstructure for the bridge. Similar refits were also seen on Revenge-class and Renown-class, which both were reinforced with more anti-air capabilities.\n\nEven though the battleship production was paused, Britain found another breakthrough in its carrier forces. Royal Navy once pioneered in carriers. In 1918, the conversion of liner Conte Rosso gave birth to the first full-length flight deck aircraft carrier in human history, the HMS Argus. Since then, Royal Navy had again experimented on the construction of HMS Hermes and HMS Eagle, which were later followed by the reconstruction of Courageous-class cruisers. By 1936, the Royal Navy possessed a fleet of five carriers of different sizes, with a new generation of armored carrier, HMS Ark Royal, still under construction.\n\nOften overlooked, the cruisers were silent workhorses of the navy. To guard its vast colonial empire, Britain developed several classes of light-armored and flexible cruisers in the 1920s. Despite lacking firepower and protection, these cruisers, including County-class and Leander-class, were designed to cruise distant waters and deployed at every key point along Britain's trade routes, forming the empire's most trustworthy escorting forces together with new destroyers.\n\nAs the world steadily moving toward 1940, it seemed nothing could go wrong for the British Empire. However, with rumors that Japan and Italy were trying to pull away from the naval treaty and heading to another arms race, it cast a shadow of uncertainty over the crumbling Versailles System. For the time being, the Royal Navy still ruled the waves, but there is no time to waste for a rearmament. "
 naval_lore_desc_2_usa: "Demanded by the treaty, all American capital ships laid after 1920 were cancelled and scrapped, that also included USS Washington laid earlier. Several obsolete dreadnoughts were disarmed and turned into training ships, leaving the US with around a dozen heavily armored but extremely slow battleships.\n\nThis was not all in vain, the aircraft carriers USS Saratoga and USS Lexington were built on the hulls of partially built battlecruisers that had been cancelled by the treaty, which largely strengthened America's naval aviation forces. In fact, the US research on naval aviation dated back to 1910 when civilian pilot Eugene Ely took off from USS Birmingham in a Curtiss Model D. In 1920, the collier Jupiter was installed with a full-length flight deck and named USS Langley, which was the recognized starting point of US carriers.\n\nIn the next decade, even though the United States thrived during the Roaring Twenties, they navy did not get huge investments. Instead it mainly focused on renovating old battleships and destroyers. The late 1920s witnessed America's attempt to build modern cruisers, this was represented by its first treaty cruiser, the Pensacola-class, and was followed by more standardized Northampton- and Portland-class. But American shipbuilding effort was soon faced with a major blow, the Great Depression.\n\nBelieved by many to be caused by overcapacity, the reason of Great Depression could be more complicated. Irregulated expansion of capitalism, excessive issuance of consumer loans and gold standard were all considered to be a part of what caused this global disaster. While it smashed the American Dream and left millions of American people in poverty and companies in bankruptcy, the economic crisis also did great damage to the naval development. What started as a stock market crash quickly became an endless and continuous loop of hell for the country under President Hoover's disastrous policies.\n\nShortly after President Franklin Roosevelt was inaugurated in 1933, he was left with an America torn not only in economy but also in society. The New Deal proposed by him put a lot emphasis on relieving labors, while Roosevelt, once the second chief in the Navy Department during the Great War, also gave the navy full support to expand even in these uncertain times. As a source of funds, the Public Works Administration diverted plenty of resources and workers for the naval expansion. The achievements would include the launch of Yorktown-class carriers, leading to the USN becoming one of the most powerful navies in the world by 1936.\n\nWith or without funding, the USN never stopped experiments on new tactics. A series of exercises, known as the Fleet Problem, were held extensively during the interwar period. The scale of exercises shrank under Hoover's administration in post-depression era, but back to normal after Roosevelt took over. In return, senior leaders were eager for innovation and experimented with new technologies, such as magnetic torpedoes, and developed a strategy called War Plan Orange for victory in the Pacific in a hypothetical war with Japan that might eventually become reality.\n\nAlthough the New Deal has achieved initial success, the recovery of America's economy still had a long way to go. As the storm gathering on the horizon, it was more obvious that wars are coming to Europe and Asia once again like 1914. The United States, staying neutral for now, is the last stronghold of peace and freedom, or is it?"
 naval_lore_desc_2_jap: "Identifying the US as the greatest threat to its hegemony, Japan devoted to improve the quality of ships. Although Japan was among the first countries to experiment the naval aviation, the debate between battleship and carrier was heated among admirals. Meanwhile, there was another debate on whether to remain in the Washington System, headed by Katō Tomosaburō and Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu respectively.\n\nThere was one thing for sure, IJN was too weak to take on the USN on the Pacific, its only way is to lure American fleets into a trap and consume them as many as possible before Japan's battleships can overwhelm them in one combat. This is known as the \"Decisive Battle\" theory, which profoundly influenced Japan's ship designs and doctrine throughout the 1930s.\n\nIn the 1920s, most of ships underwent extensive refit and modernisation, including the armoring of Kongo-class and engine modifications on Nagato-class. Realizing the inferiority, Japanese naval architects tended to mount more armor and firepower on a single ship. It came to fruition as the Special-Type destroyers, or Fubuki/Ayanami/Akatsuki-class destroyers. Displacing 1,750 tons, the Special-Types were way larger than typical American destroyers built before 1930, with even more firepower, and were later equipped with the infamous Type-93 oxygen torpedo. The Type-93, also known as the Long Lance, also saw service on cruisers such as Myoko and Takao. However, excessive emphasis on the armaments led to poor stability. The Tomozure Incident and later Fourth Fleet Incident all pointed to flaws in the design, leading to much more time and funds wasted in improving the seaworthiness and stability of ships.\n\nIn response to the London Naval Conference of 1930, Japan started a series of naval construction programs to strengthen its cruiser forces based on the terms of London Treaty. These plans were known as the Maru Keikaku (Fleet Replenishment Plan, or literally Circle Plan), and would begin in 1931, 1934, 1937 and 1939, in an attempt to catch up with the US. The first plan was centered around Mogami-class cruisers, which were the largest light cruisers ever built within the restriction, provoking the US to respond with the Brooklyn-class. The second plan focused on expanding Japan's carrier forces, with two carriers, Soryu and Hiryu, planned. Just a few years ago, Ryujo was laid to exploit a loophole in the treaty that a carrier under 10,000 tons was not regarded as \"carrier\", marking the startpoint of Japan's light carriers. This effort was later followed by conversions of Zuiho and Ryuho.\n\nAs the start date of the Third Maru Keikaku nearing, many high-ranking officers and officials believed that Japan would withdraw from the on-going Second London Conference. Within IJN, the evaluation of a class of super battleships was secretly underway. Shadowing all the battleships built before, it would mount nine 460mm guns, which would be the largest naval guns ever invented. Japan has dedicated all to defeat the United States in a future conflict, but no one in IJN was confident enough to claim an obvious victory.\n\nWith political turmoils and Sino-Japanese relationship reaching another breaking point ever since 1895, Japan seemed like a train without a brake, heading towards the abyss of war. As the military growing bolder by its invasion of China, concerns from the western powers applying trade sanctions brought Japan with a fear of being cut off from the world. No matter how, Japan must take action before it's too late."
 naval_lore_desc_2_fra: "To maintain her position of a major naval power, France would have to follow the other four major naval powers with her own treaty cruiser. The earliest modern cruiser design Service Techniques des Constructions Navales (STNC - Constructor's Department) had to draw on was the 8,000 ton Duguay Trouin-class design, which was authorized under the 1924 build program, sacrificing protection for speed while maintaining the 10,000 ton displacement restriction. Together with Duquesne-class, they were the first major French warships built after the Great War and proved successful and seaworthy. Built in a couple of years based on Duquesne, the subsequent Suffren-class further improved their armor while retaining the same armament.\n\nMeanwhile, even more efforts were made on large destroyers. Preliminary studies for large destroyers by the Naval General Staff (NGS) began before Great War, but were suspended when the war began. They resumed when the NGS decided to split the role of the destroyer in 1919. The smaller torpilleur d'escadre would have the role of attacking the enemy's battleline with torpedoes and defending that of the French from enemy torpedo craft, while the larger contre-torpilleur was for scouting. This required high speed in all weather, good endurance and a powerful armament capable of engaging small cruisers.\n\nThe first attempt would be the Chacal-class, and they were followed by similarly designed Guepard-, Aigle-, and Vauquelin-class in the early 1930s, all of them displaced over 2,000 tons. The ultimate form of large destroyer finally evolved into a serious competitor of light cruiser, which was represented by Le Fantasque-class. Powered by two geared Rateau-Breguet or Parsons steam turbines, each of the ships greatly exceeded their designed speed in sea trials, ranging from 41.4 to 45.1 knots. In 1930, Émile Bertin, a French fast light cruiser was laid and became the basis for later light and heavy cruisers, particularly the slightly larger La Galissonnière-class. Heavy cruiser Algérie was ordered at the same time, and turned out to be the last treaty cruiser built by France.\n\nWith the naval treaty, French battleship studies initially focused on countering fast Italian cruisers, leading to early designs for small, relatively lightly protected capital ships. But the advent of Deutschland-class cruisers, or panzerschiff, proved to be more threatening to French interests, prompting the need for larger vessels. The resulting design of Dunkerque-class produced a small battleship armed with eight 330mm guns that were concentrated in two quadruple gun turrets forward. Smaller and less armed, the Dunkerques have sometimes been referred to as battlecruisers.\n\nIn response to Italy's Littorio-class battleships laid in the previous year, France ordered two fast battleships in 1935. The Richelieu-class scaled up to accommodate 380mm guns and heavier armor. To keep the ships within the displacement limits, they featured the same concentrated arrangement as the Dunkerques for the main battery, but they were still a little surpassing the restrictions. They also incorporated more compact boilers that allowed for a shorter hull for the desired top speed.\n\nDespite being behind the UK, US and Japan, the French Navy still kept its lineage inherited from the imperial times, and it would still be an important branch of the Third Republic's military forces in the 1930s. But with atmosphere shifting in Europe, especially in Germany, fear about another Franco-German conflict has reached such a pitch. Different thoughts about war or peace has greatly torn French society apart, and it remains a question whether the French people have the confidence about winning another war."
 naval_lore_desc_2_ita: "In 1923, the British response to the Corfu incident left Benito Mussolini and his military advisors convinced that Italy was \"imprisoned in the Mediterranean\" through British bases in Gibraltar, the Suez Canal, Malta, and Cyprus.\n\nDuring the interwar period, the Regia Marina chose to build fast ships armed with longer ranged guns to give the Italian vessels the ability to minimize close contact with vessels of the Royal Navy, whose crews were more experienced. New guns were developed with longer ranges than their British counterparts. Speed was emphasized in their new construction.\n\nIn the early 1920s, the Regia Marina began design studies for cruisers that would adhere to the limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty. In 1924, the French Navy laid down the first of two Duquesne-class cruisers, prompting the Regia Marina to order two Trento-class to match their rival. The designers emphasized very high speed, which required a significant reduction in armor protection. When the French started to produce the Le Fantasque-class destroyers, which were superior in firepower to other destroyers, this convinced Italy to respond with the Condottieri-type cruisers that would be of intermediate size between the new French destroyer class and cruisers.  Among them, Giussano- and Cadorna-class were almost the same while the later Montecuccoli had significantly better protection. Similar enhancement was also seen on Zara-class, which violated the limitations to acquire thicker armor.\n\nMeanwhile, modernisation on the four obsolete battleships including Conte di Cavour and Andrea Doria turned into a significant reconstruction project, with only 40% of the original structures being left. Their guns were upgraded, going from thirteen 305mm guns to ten 320mm guns, and the coal-fired boilers were replaced with modern oil-fired boilers. These works lasted for several years and has not finished yet in 1936.\n\nThe Regia Marina, witnessing the success of French large destroyers, devoted more resources to develop destroyers with similar size. While the initial post-war destroyers had a standard displacement of around 1,000 tons, the Navigatori-class built in 1928 raised this number to 1,900 tons, which was very close to the French Chacal-class. In terms of armaments, the 120mm guns were widely used on these ships. However, the following Freccia- and Folgore-class didn't continue this trend due to an unsuccessful attempt to reduce their beams to achieve higher speed. The lessons learned would be vital to the construction of the next generation of destroyers, represented by the Oriani-class.\n\nBy 1930, France turn laid down two Dunkerque-class battleships armed with eight 330mm guns. In late 1932, Italian constructors responded with a design similar to the Deutschland class, but armed with six 343mm guns in triple turrets on a 18,000 tons displacement, but the navy decided that a larger design should be pursued. The resulting Littorio-class had two ships planned initially, with Littorio and Vittorio Veneto being laid in 1934. However, due to rising tensions around the world, the navy feared that only two Littorios would not be enough to counter the British and French Mediterranean Fleets. In December 1935, Admiral Domenico Cavagnari proposed to Mussolini that two more battleships (Roma and Impero) should be built to attempt to counter a possible Franco-British alliance. But Mussolini postponed his decision.\n\nWith invasion of Ethiopia, Italy is gradually breaking peace and stability of the world, which are met with warm welcome from Germany, another revanchist state eager to take back what was lost in the war 20 years ago. It's still unclear what kind of role the Regia Marina will play in these uncertain times."
