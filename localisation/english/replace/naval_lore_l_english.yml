The 20th century witnessed the rise of naval powers, and the navy has been playing a vital role in global strategy.\n\nEver since the Second Naval Arms Race, navies of the world have been innovating and expanding their fleet. From wolfpacks beneath the sea to behemoths on the surface, modernized warships dominates every inch of the waters."

 Naval_lore.0.t: "Imperial Japanese Navy: 1910-1925"
 Naval_lore.0.d: "By the beginning of Sino-Japanese War, Japan had already built up considerable naval power with imported battleships. Victories over Qing and Russia at the turn of the 20th century marked a new dawn in Japan's regional hegemony and a rapid growth of its navy. Being the only nation in Asia with a significant naval presence, Japan fought alongside the United Kingdom and occupied most German possessions in the Pacific upon the start of the Weltkrieg.\n\nWithout a nearby battlefront, Japanese resources were diverted to naval construction. Once dwarfed by European, Japanese Navy had taken a leap since the commission of Kongo-class which first adopted uniform caliber used on dreadnoughts. Laid in 1912, the Fuso-class became its first effort to build dreadnoughts of western standard even with the flawed multi-turret design, and two Ise-class with revised layout were built three years later. Upon that, the Eight-Eight Fleet initiative was proposed by Naval General Staff to fund another four battleships in the following years. It started with two Nagato-class armed with eight 410mm guns in 1917, while two Tosa-class with an additional twin 410mm battery were ordered in 1920. Both can sail at 26kn despite tonnage raise. Alongside them were four Amagi-class battlecruisers, with Takao destroyed in the 1923 Kanto Earthquake. A few squadrons of Kamikaze- and Mutsuki-class destroyers were then built to counter the threat from the United States Navy.\n\nAfter Japanese naval aviation began in 1912 with the establishment of the Commission on Naval Aeronautical Research, several seaplane carriers were converted from other vessels. The experience would be crucial in the design of Hosho, the first to be built from the keel up as an aircraft carrier.\n\nDespite the peace deal signed between the Entente and Central Powers in 1919, Japan refused to surrender what was gained in the war, but it eventually gave up in the 1921 Tsingtao Accord facing British and American pressure. The peace didn't halt Japan's naval expansion and it placed orders for four Kii-class in response to Germany's Preußen-class. However, they were soon outdated before commission as UK and Germany started to build battleships with 18-inch guns such as Magnificent and Schleisien. It was then that \"Battleship M\" with twelve 460mm guns, later know as Aki-class, were laid, and yet it would be in vain when the Great Depression reached Japan's shore in 1925. Japan sank 70% of its annual budget in the navy just a year ago. Fearing envy from the army and public opposition, Aki-class were scrapped and sold along with Suruga and Omi of the Kii-class. It was not until the end of 1920s that Kii and Owari were finally finished, four years behind schedule."
 Naval_lore.1.t: "Imperial Japanese Navy: 1925-1936"
 Naval_lore.1.d: "Japanese Navy entered a dark era right after its funds got cut in 1925, with a large number of old capital ships waiting to be replaced.\n\nFifteen years had passed since the commission of Kongo, the navy was in urgent need of new battlecruisers, but huge ship was no longer an option. Settling for the second best, two Furutaka-class cruisers were designed based on B65 project. As a large cruiser, B65 would lead destroyers in night combats and torpedo strikes, which was an indispensable part of Japan's \"Decisive Battle\" strategy. Although it was not an easy task to overhaul the design, the navy managed to reuse some old technologies from Kongo, and installed six 356mm guns on Furutaka. In 1926, Furutaka and Kako were orderd, followed by slightly tuned Aoba and Kinugasa in just a few months. They were grouped into one class in some western archives, and were categorized as revived armored cruiser by German and pocket battlecruiser by British.\n\nMeanwhile, Japan was devoted to develop destroyers. It had been a trend since the end of the war that destroyers and cruisers would become larger to overwhelm their rivals. The Type-1924 destroyers built by Germany only made it more pronounced. The Navy Technical Department upgraded the designs and proposed the Special-Type destroyers. They, such as Fubuki-, Ayanami- and Akatsuki-class, became known for the high speed and heavy armaments including six 127mm guns in three turrets and the infamous Type-93 oxygen torpedo. Despite their theoretically superior firepower, the lighter hull would soon expose problems of poor stability, which was improved in the construction of Shiratsuyu-class and the refit of defective ships.\n\nWith economy gradually recovered in the 1930s, Japan could spared more budgets for its navy. In 1932, the commission of Ryujo ended the nation's neglect of aircraft carriers for ten years. Immediately after that, the Imperial Navy limped to upgrade its ships in the first ship replenishment plan (First Maru Keikaku), including four Tokachi-class cruisers and the submarine tender Taigei which was later converted to Ryuen, while the Second Maru Keikaku started in 1934 gave birth to four newly designed cruisers, the Monobe-class. Although Tokachi- and Monobe-class were inferior to German and American competitors, they were favored by navy for versatility and low cost. Influenced by Republic-class, Soryu was ordered in 1934 as the first fleet carrier of Japan, also one of the most advanced in the world.\n\nAs soon as the Second Maru Keikaku was completed, Japan would once again engage in heavy investments of its navy and eventually become the naval superpower on the Pacific Ocean."

 Naval_lore.2.t: "Imperial German Navy: 1910-1920"
 Naval_lore.2.d: "The Imperial German Navy embarked on a massive fleet expansion program right after the commission of HMS Dreadnought. Rising from a naval race with the United Kingdom, Germany had rapidly grown into the second-strongest naval power in the world. Its first dreadnought, SMS Nassau, was quickly outdated, and the same fate also had the Helgoland-class. From 1910 to 1914, Germany slowly caught up with Britain in terms of dreadnoughts, having König-class as its first battleship with all turrets placed on the centerline. Abundant resources were also put into the constrcution of battlecruisers. German battlecruiser emphasized defense over speed, this deviated from \"speed over defense\" theory invented by British. By 1914, three classes of battlecruisers, including Von der Tann and Moltke, were developed. Though the war forced the focus of military production to lean towards the army, there were four Bayern-class battleships and three Derfflinger-class battlecruisers planned.\n\nDespite the tactical victory in the Battle of Jutland, Germany failed to break Royal Navy's blockade, encouraging General Ludendorff to propose reopening the unrestricted submarine warfare. Fearing a potential Ludendorff dictatorship, the Kaiser decided against him, supporting the chancellor. It turned out that, though the dictatorship was just delayed, it near-eliminated the risk of the United States declaring war on Germany. Orders of submarines were canceled and diverted to surface fleet. Witnessing heavy losses of British battlecruisers, however, Germany tried to adapt theirs to longer combat distance. Commissioned along with SMS Württemberg in 1918, the resulting Mackensen-class were equipped with thicker deck armor and 350mm guns.\n\nDefeated in the Great Spring Offensive in mid-1918, the morale of Entente was crushed, while Germany had its forces on the western front reinforced by veterans from the eastern theatre. By the end of 1919, the French government, facing internal syndical revolts, had no choice but submitted to German conditions after the decisive Kaiserschlacht. Emerging victorious in the Weltkrieg, the navy was once again well funded as the army seized to expand. Opposition was gone in the Reichstag after lobbying by military complex. With the nearing completion of SMS Preußen in 1920, seven modified Siegfried-class were ordered to phase out dreadnoughts built before the war, they would be built in three groups throughout the years to come. Armed with eight 420mm guns and 350mm armor belt, they were considered the best then. However, the United Kingdom was provoked by Germany's shipbuilding programs, which couldn't afford another defeat on the sea after losing its allies on the European continent. With only four Admirals in construction after the war, Royal Navy decided to sink millions of pounds to renew its aging fleet, starting with four Magnificent-class battleships and four Nelson-class battlecruisers in 1921. This action was later escalated to the Second Naval Arms Race on the global scale."


 Naval_lore.3.t: "Imperial German Navy: 1920-1936"
 Naval_lore.3.d: "The shipbuilding frenzy continued with soaring British investments, and it was followed by the United States and Japan in a few months. None of them dared to slack off and put dozens of battleships into construction.\n\nFacing six British battlecruisers with 15-inch guns, Germany decided to end this with Yorck-class, an upgraded version of Mackensen-class with 380mm guns. Three were ordered at first, and two were added to outnumber their rivals. During this period, Germany built an average of three capital ships every year, far exceeding its original plan. To counter the Magnificent-class, the Schleisien-class, designed based on L27 project, were equipped with nine 480mm guns and improved armor, which inevitably reduced its speed to 23kn even with new steam turbines. Their funding started in 1923, among five planned, only SMS Schleisien and SMS Strelitz were completed and became the flagships of Hochseeflotte. Being larger than any ship built before, Schleisien along with Magnificent and South Carolina, were called super-heavy dreadnoughts.\n\nThe record made by Schleisien was soon broken by the 80,000-ton SMS Kaiser Wilhelm. It took Krupp half a year to widen its largest dock for the hull and another seven years to complete. It was launched in 1928 to celebrate the Ruby Jubilee of Kaiser and toured the globe after its completion in 1932. However, it suffered frequent malfunctions from complex structure, wasting years for maintainence.\n\nMeanwhile, a group of cruisers and destroyers were built to escort battleships. They were represented by Aachen-class cruisers and Type-1924 destroyers. In 1927, five Prinz Heinrich-class cruisers were built to guard the empire's vast colonies with four of them assigned to East Asian Fleet. Armed with six 280mm cannons, their costs were only 60% of battleships. Three years later, they were replaced by enhanced Prinz Adalbert-class with an extra battery.\n\nFor a long time, Germany had paid little attention to its carriers, and they were just considered the subsititute for Zeppelins. In 1918, the liner Ausonia was converted to a carrier, SMS Main, at request of the aviation department. Some other civilian vessels also saw such conversion but only performed tasks after Zeppelins were retired. It took ten years before the advanced Weser-class, with a top speed of 32kn and armor immune to 8-inch shells, were approved by Reichstag to phase out Main-class.\n\nEntering the 1930s, the naval office was ultimately back to reason from super-dreadnought-maniac and planned a few fast battleships. The Blücher-class with eight 420mm guns was built in 1933 as a new type of battleships to balance firepower, defense and speed. A year later, two of them, Roon and Blumenthal, were converted to carriers in response to Republican Navy's super carrier, RNS Rebecca.\n\nBy 1936, though the German navy still maintained its formidable size, it no longer possessed an edge over the expanding Republican Navy and Japanese Navy."

 Naval_lore.4.t: "British Royal Navy: 1905-1925"
 Naval_lore.4.d: "Possessing the largest navy in the Victorian Era, the United Kingdom had always been the strongest naval power since the mid-19th century, and led the naval development through its unparalleled technologies.\n\nIn the 1900s, Europe was on the brink of war when Germany's ambition to pursue a place in the sun threatened old colonial empires. The Royal Navy got unprecedented investments against expanding German forces. The launch of HMS Dreadnought in 1905 started the naval evolution, whose uniform caliber marked the advent of central fire control and changed the rule of naval combat. Other powers developed their dreadnoughts in merely four years. The United Kingdom, however, answered with four classes of dreadnoughts including St. Vincent- and Bellerophon-class. With superfire structure achieved on HMS Orion, it outdated all dreadnoughts built before 1909. The King George V- and Iron Duke-class also followed such layout.\n\nInspired by HMS Invincible, battlecruiser that trades defense for speed was invented. Launched before the war, the Queen Elizabeth-class also embraced the superiority of speed as fast battleships, with seven economical but slower Revenge-class (two were refitted as Renown-class) ordered to ensure predominance.\n\nThe Battle of Jutland saw the failure of British battlecruisers and profoundly changed the designing of battleships. The lessons learned would be vital to the development of long-range guns and fire control systems. Although Royal Navy stood unchallenged on the sea, the cracks were to appear on the land. With Russian Empire collapsing into a civil war, the Entente was in desperate need of support from the New World, but the US stayed neutral. The truce was signed with Germany in 1919, and Britain secured peace without losing its colonies. The end of war paused its naval programs, but not Germany's.\n\nSeven Siegfried-class battleships were approved by Reichstag at the end of 1920, which left Britain with only four Admiral-class under construction. To avoid the dilemma of having zero 16-inch-gun battleship, the DNC (Department of Naval Construction) approved N3 and G3 designs which adopted all-or-nothing armor scheme and placed main batteries forward of engines. In 1921, four Magnificent-class armed with nine 18-inch guns were laid, along with four similarly designed Nelson-class battlecruisers using 16-inch guns, forcing other countries to answer with bigger ships.\n\nThe Royal Navy also pioneered in aircraft carriers. In 1918, liner Conte Rosso was converted to HMS Argus and became the first carrier with a full-length flight deck. Followed by HMS Hermes, they contributed to the establishment of naval aviation corps. The effort continued with the refit of Courageous-class in 1924, but it ended halfway when British Revolution outbroke."

 Naval_lore.5.d: "Britain's economy was hit hard after losing its trade partners in Europe. The political turmoil was intense as the Labour Party fell apart on Ramsay MacDonald's attempt to join the National Coalition. PM Austin Chamberlain likewise faced public fury for economic failures, especially the disastrous fiscal austerity policy.\n\nThe bill was passed by House of Lords in May 1924, targeting Royal Navy's expansion in recent years. It intended to stop the crisis, but made thousands of shipbuilders and soldiers lose their jobs. In an instant, shipyards across Great Britain went silent. As society grew unstable due to unemployment, the Royal Navy became the last straw.\n\nOn May 13th, when HMS Hood and HMS Repulse returned to Plymouth after the one-year Imperial Tour, sailors mutinied after learning pay cuts. Captain John Thurn ordered Marines to board the ship, but they joined the sailors instead. This was later known as HMS Hood Incident. The government's decision to send in the police only made it worse and led to strong public opposition. Strikes were organized all across the nation and exacerbated tensions towards revolution.\n\nUpon the start of revolts, sailors were taken away from their units for quarantined investigations to root out syndicalist sympathizers in the navy. However, the days of monarchy were numbered as royalists lost control of Scotland and Wales. On Christmas Eve 1925, when London citizens found Communal flags flying in the streets, French commando and Republicans had already taken most parts of England in a combined offensive. Relying on the line of defense near Plymouth and Southampton, Royal Navy launched the largest evacuation in history, escorting thousands of nobles, troops, and civilians to Canada.\n\nThe evacuation was hasty that few ships under construction were completely destroyed. As the primary assets, only three Magnificent-class managed to sail, while HMS Venerable was destroyed by royalists due to engine failure. Construction sites of Nelson-class were taken by workers, but HMS Drake withdrew successfully. Without orders from London, the China Station abandoned colonies and left for Australia, its fleet was later regrouped into Australasian Royal Navy.\n\nDespite a strong presence on the Atlantic, Royal Navy lacked funding due to Canada's limited revenue and had not seen any ships put in service since 1925. It was then reinforced by four Moncton-class cruisers with extraordinary maneuverability in 1933. Two Blenheim-class, designed by Charles Lilicrap as 18,500-ton battlecruisers with six 10-inch guns, were ordered in 1932.\n\nContradictions between exiles and local government persisted in the 1930s, which also affected the relationship between the ex-British Naval Command and Canadian Naval Command. The fate of Royal Navy seems uncertain for now."

The government's decision to send in the police only made it worse and led to strong public opposition. Strikes were organized all across the nation and exacerbated tensions towards revolution.\n\nThe civil war almost tore Britain apart, and Republican Navy likewise faced great challenges. On the one hand, most of the navy stayed loyal to the King and they destroyed quite a few ships at home, which left Republican Navy with no operating ships. On the other hand, it lacked experienced officers and engineers as most of them fled to Canada. To relieve the workers, the NCC (Naval Construction Committee) decided to provide jobs by renovating old warships, including Renown- and Courageous-class. These works had lasted until the early 1930s due to lack of funds.\n\nTo distance itself from the aristocratic system in the past, the navy renamed some ships symbolizing the monarchy, like Tolpuddle for Malborough, Leveller for Queen Elizabeth, and John Churchill for King George V.\n\nWith internal situation stabilized, the Republican Navy initiated a large scale of modernization in 1931. Although young officers had little interest in battleships, the NCC still pushed its agenda to order four Union-class battleships, a design originated from the M2 project with twelve 18-inch guns. It is considered one of the most powerful battleships and a serious competitor of Kaiser Wilhelm. It then answered with two Republic-class after learning Germany's new move to reinforce its carrier forces. The armored flight deck was first applied on these ships, which became the characteristics of Republican carriers. At the same time, RNS Equality, one of Union-class, was converted to the largest aircraft carrier in the world, RNS Rebecca. Alongside them, there were Bondfield-class battleships, Measureless-class cruisers and A/B-class destroyers. As Union's first type of battleship designed free from conservatives, the Bondfield-class applied a conventional layout and 16-inch guns, heralding a great technological advantage.\n\nNo one would doubt that the Republican Navy is at the first line of navies. The form of naval warfare centered around aircraft carriers might be the future, but everything was still unknown in 1936."

 Naval_lore.7.t: "The United States Navy: 1905-1920"
 Naval_lore.7.d: "In 1890, The Influence of Seapower Upon History by Alfred Mahan was published. It discussed the various factors needed to support and achieve sea power, with emphasis on having the largest and most powerful fleet. For the United States, the theory justified investments in the navy, allowing expansionism to gaze at farther frontiers from the Caribbean to the Pacific.\n\nThe election of Theodore Roosevelt in 1901 was considered a milestone to the US Navy. Influenced by the Russo-Japanese War and the launch of HMS Dreadnought, he gave the greenlight to the naval expansion and organized the global tour of Great White Fleet in 1907. By 1912, another eight dreadnoughts had been built including Florida- and Wyoming-class, with 14-inch guns first applied to New York-class in 1914.\n\nThe United States kept its neutrality and traded with both sides during the war, making plenty of funds for its navy. It came to fruition as Nevada-class, the first standard-type battleship, and innovations such as triple-mounted guns and all-or-nothing armor scheme. Another two Pennsylvania-class that completely adopted triple batteries were laid just three months later. However, the increasing funding of the navy met opposition from Senator Benjamin Tillman, who asked to build maximum battleships to end the naval race once and for all. But his proposal was never considered seriously at that time.\n\nPlanned before the Battle of Jutland, the designs of New Mexico- and Tennessee-class were already outdated in 1916, but the General Board's appeal to equip them with heavier armor was shot down by Secretary of Navy, Josephus Daniels, who insisted on standardization. Only their torpedo bulkheads and elevation of guns were improved. However, the threats from German and Japanese Navy focred the US to apply bigger guns, starting with four Colorado-class in 1918 and six Lexington-class in 1920. Construction of ten Omaha-class cruisers and dozens of destroyers was approved to reinforce the recon forces.\n\nThe United States gained nothing for its loans to the Entente, with France collapsed into anarchy and the United Kingdom in decline. Still, its liberalized economy soared under the McAdoo administration in the early 1920s, known as the Roaring Twenties. In the face of intensifying naval race on the other side of the Atlantic, the United States couldn't afford to stay out of it.\n\nWith Germany, Britain, and Japan increasing naval expenditures, the US Navy, however, faced the dilemma of budget cuts due to pacifism and isolationism in Congress. Despite lagging behind Britain and Germany, America's industry was still strong enough to update its capital ships, no slower than European countries."
 
 Naval_lore.8.t: "The United States Navy: 1920-1936"
 Naval_lore.8.d: "In the early 1920s, six South Dakota-class battleships were ordered to compete with European counterparts. Its design deviated from previous ones due to technological advance as the development of fast battleships, such as Queen Elizabeth and Nagato, had deprived the place of slow battleships in the fleet, and South Dakota increased its speed by two knots.\n\nHowever, standard-type battleships were soon outdated facing super dreadnoughts. The first battleship to adopt 18-inch guns, the Magnificent, learned from naval battles during the war and applied the most advanced technologies, considered unsinkable by many. In an attempt to catch up, the US government sank millions into the navy, and the \"Maximum Battleship\" came in handy. Filtering some non-sense such as the one with six-mounted main batteries, the IV-2 project with twelve 18-inch guns was chosen. Weeks after HMS Magnificent was laid, Congress approved a budget for five South Carolina-class on the premise that all South Dakota-class would be canceled.\n\nNevertheless, an economic crisis hit the United States when shipyards were operating at full speed. Looming tensions in the United Kingdom had put the New York stock market in decline throughout 1924, but Wall Street still expressed optimism about it. Covered by bubble of prosperity, it was a large number of bad debts from excessive issuance of consumer loans, like a bomb about to explode. The nightmare came true at the outbreak of the British Revolution. In April 1925, the stock market plummeted without warning, bankrupting countless companies and individuals.\n\nThe coming Great Depression changed the fate of a generation as well as the navy. The construction of Lexington- and South Carolina-class was suspended due to lack of funds, and that was when aircraft carriers caught the navy's eye. The US research on naval aviation dated back to 1910 when civilian pilot Eugene Ely took off from USS Birmingham in a Curtiss Model D. In 1920, the collier Jupiter was installed with a full-length flight deck and named USS Langley, which was the recognized starting point of US carriers. USS Ranger and USS Constellation were the first to undergo carrier conversion, followed by USS Massachusetts later. On the bright side, the three carriers accelerated the development of equipments and tactics.\n\nIn the late 1920s, the underfunded navy had not seen any battleship put in service for more than five years, and cheaper cruisers were considered. The US Navy led the world by large cruiser with six Northampton-class built in 1928. Designed as a heavy scout cruiser, Northampton had nine 8-inch guns and a displacement of 10,000 tons. In response to revived armored cruisers, two Pensacola-class with 10-inch guns were ordered in 1930, becoming one of the largest cruisers ever built.\n\nIn 1936, the United States struggled to maintain its two-ocean navy. However, nobody knew if the US Navy can prevail in the next war facing dominant German Empire and an ambitious Japan. Or shall it protect the crumbling freedom and democracy?"
 
 FRA_naval_lore: "History of French Navy"
 Naval_lore.9.t: "French National Navy: 1900-1920"
 Naval_lore.9.d: "Founded in the 17th century, the French Navy was one of the oldest navies still in continual service, with precursors dating back to the Middle Ages. It has taken part in key events in history including the Napoleonic War and Weltkrieg, and played an important role in establishing and securing the French colonial empire for 400 years. The French Navy pioneered several innovations in naval technologies, such as the first ironclad and first mechanically propelled submarine.\n\nHowever, the development of French Navy slowed down when naval races between the United Kingdom and Germany grew in intensity. It entered the 20th century with only a dozen of pre-dreadnoughts in service. It was not until 1910 that four Courbet-class dreadnoughts were laid, which were characterized by longer but thinner waterline belt against underwater hits. In 1912, three Bretagne-class were ordered. They were an improvement of the previous Courbet-class and mounted ten 340mm guns instead of twelve 305mm guns as on the Courbets, which only saw limited service in the war. The fourth was ordered by Greece but suspended due to the war. They were followed by five Normandie-class in 1913, the only warships to adopt quadruple batteries at that time.\n\nFrance entered the war with relatively few modern vessels, and naval production was hampered as the main French effort was on land. While Royal Navy held the North Sea, the French Navy was active in the Mediterranean, where they mostly kept watch on the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Once Italy entered the war on the Allied side in May 1915, the French Navy moved to more forward bases at Brindisi on the Italian Adriatic coast and the Greek island of Corfu. From there, it launched an amphibious invasion on Athens in 1916, forcing the pro-German Greek government to side with the Entente. French destroyer squadrons also played an important role in countering Germany's U-boat campaign by regularly patrolling the seas and escorting convoys.\n\nWhen the Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919, France was on the brink of a civil war as anarcho-syndicalist riots swept across most parts of the country. Although no restriction was put on France's naval development, it no longer had the resources and funds to feed its navy. The Normandies were left rotten in the dock with tens of other warships in extremely poor condition. Germany, however, secretly provided the syndicalists with arms and money in order to further destabilize France. The strategy, similar to what Germany used in Russia, was all but successful in the long term, which eventually unleashed a syndical menace in the near future. To the Third Republic, it was a moment of life and death.\n\nWanting a nation-wide negotiation with the Provisional Government on workers' treatment, the leaders of CGT (General Confederation of Labour), the most influential socialist party in France, were rational and tried to prevent the radical Jacobins, who appealed a violent revolution led by Bolsheviks, from launching attacks. The establishments lost all their patience when mild leftists failed to stop the escalation of crisis, which ultimately led to the French Civil War."

 Naval_lore.10.t: "French National Navy: 1920-1936"
 Naval_lore.10.d: "As conditions grew untenable for the French government and the military high command, they eventually retreated from the mainland, choosing exile instead of surrender, hoping that this temporary situation would soon be resolved as the newly created Federation of Communes of France would undoubtedly either quickly collapse on itself, or be put down by the German Empire. Neither happened, and the Commune secured the recognition as the legitimate successor of the French Republic by Germany and members of Mitteleuropa.\n\nEscorted by Mediterranean Fleet, the exiles arrived at North Africa in June 1920, and claimed that they will take back the mainland one day. However, the African colonies lacked basic industries and resources to build an army for counter-attack. In the early 1920s, the main forces of National Navy were two Courbets, two Bretagnes, and a couple of pre-dreadnoughts including Danton- and Liberté-class. It could rely on dockyards in Ferryville and Dakar to maintain some of screen ships.\n\nFacing more and more tense confrontations off the coast of Corsica, the National Navy was forced to place orders for ships to prepare for a possible invasion of mainland. It seized the opportunity when the political and diplomatic air began to change in Europe.\n\nWith the British Isles falling into the hellfire of revolution, old powers in Europe were keeping a watchful eye and lifted restrictions of arms exports. Among them, Two Sicilies was known for its busy shipyards and would export economical warships for minor powers. The first ships ordered were six 17,500-ton Pothau-class cruisers, with only Pothau herself finished due to exiles' poor finicial condition. Laid down in 1924 and completed in 1927, it was armed with two triple 330mm turrets forward of the bridge, which many similar designs would follow in years ahead.\n\nOut of strategic consideration, the Austro-Hungarian Empire also gave greenlight to one of its largest naval contractors, STT (Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino), to export a couple of battleships. The resulting Union Sacrée-class battleships, Union Sacrée and France, were armed with nine 410mm guns and laid in 1931, referencing Austrian design of Hunyadi-class to a large extent. A year later, the orders of two Nice-class battlecruisers designed by French engineers were also given to STT. Fitted eight 330mm guns in two quadruple-mounted turrets, the Nices were one of the most potent warships in the Mediterranean.\n\nRegardless of how many new ships were bought, the exiles were too vulnerable to take on the syndicalists alone. After the collapse of British Empire, the remnants of the Entente Cordiale were quickly marginalized on the world stage, and it seemed that the return to motherland would never come. However, with dark clouds of war once again gathering over Europe, the exiles will bide its time. When the final struggle arrives, the National Navy is going to be the spearhead of French Republic."
 Naval_lore.11.t: "French People's Liberation Navy: 1920-1936"
 Naval_lore.11.d: "During the Civil War, the French navy was divided as was the rest of the nation. There were some engagements between the nationalist and the syndicalist naval units, but most of the ships remained in their ports as fuel was scarce and the crews divided. When war was over, ships stayed in France became the backbone of the newborn French People's Liberation Navy, or Marine de libération du Peuple.\n\nThe navy has two main fleets based in Brest and Toulon. It was relatively undeveloped since France's main military effort was on land, and the navy was only for patrolling territorial waters and preventing landings into southern and northern coasts, instead of projecting influence abroad. Communal Navy kept enhancing the quality of ships, starting with five Normandie-class battleships left by the Republic in the early 1920s, while Jules Guesde was converted to aircraft carrier and renamed Eugène Pottier. Despite being backward compared to those built during the Dreadnought Race, they were more than enough to protect France from the exiles and imperialists.\n\nThe defensive philosophy was gradually gone after the establishment of Union of Britain. With the political air changing in France, radical revanchism began to emerge, and the Communal Navy was then transformed into an offensive force, targeting German Empire in its weakest point - supply lines from colonies that drove its war machine. Centered around logistic raiding, France developed a few types of light ships and organized them in small groups to ambush convoys on the Atlantic. In 1927, France togethter with Socialist Italy launched the modern cruiser programs, and proposed two types of raider cruisers. It began with two Rennes-class and was followed by four Lyon-class with thicker armor. They were equipped with three triple 152mm turrets, and the new-generation steam turbines allowed them to sail at 33 knots. Witnessing the success of German submarines during the war, France also emphasized on its submarine industry which was represented by one of the most deadly, the Émeraude-class.\n\nIn an effort to renew its aging battleship squadron, the Commune ordered two Internationale-class in 1932 and assigned them to the Mediterranean fleet against expanding National Navy. Heavily armored and equipped with two quadruple 380mm turrets, they were the most feared warships by Austria and the exiles. The commission of Le Fantasque- and Mogador-class not only defined the destroyer leaders, but also turned the table on the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nFor a long time, the navy has remained a small branch of Communal military forces, but it is changing. Suffering from the exploitation by imperialism and capitalism, the proletariat of the world are all waiting for the rise of a red Gallic Rooster."

 Naval_lore.12.t: "Imperial Russian Navy: 1900-1917"
 Naval_lore.12.d: "Formally established in 1696, the Imperial Russian Navy lasted until dissolved in the wake of the February Revolution of 1917. It developed from a smaller force that had existed prior to Tsar Peter the Great's founding of the modern Russian navy during the Second Azov campaign in 1696. It expanded in late 18th century and reached its peak strength by the early part of the 19th century, behind only the British and French fleets in terms of size.\n\nHowever, Russia's slow technical and economic development in the 19th century caused her to fall behind other European countries in the field of steamboat. The glory of her navy was crushed and humiliated after swallowing a bitter defeat in the Tsushima Strait during the Russo-Japanese War, making Russia the only European country that lost to an Asian one. At the end of the war, Russia fell from the third greatest naval power to sixth place. The focus of the Russian navy then shifted from the Far East to the Baltic, defending Petersburg from the German Empire.\n\nIn 1907, a naval expansion program was put before the Duma but voted down, yet the later Bosnian Crisis forced reconsideration. Facing an inevitable German-Austrian alliance, Russia felt threatened by Austria's bolder actions targeting Serbia, a close ally of Russia. Four Gangut-class battleships were laid down in 1909 to phase out the pre-dreadnoughts in the navy and guard the Gulf of Finland. Delivered before the war, the turrets and fire controls of Ganguts were barely finished in mid-1915. Meanwhile, three similarly designed Imperatritsa Mariya-class were built for the Black Sea Fleet in response to the worsening relationship with Ottoman. The rearmament program included a significant element of foreign participation with several ships (including the cruiser Rurik) and machinery ordered from foreign firms. After the outbreak of Weltkrieg, ships and equipment being built in Germany were confiscated, and those from the United Kingdom was slow in reaching Russia or was diverted to the Western Allies' own war effort.\n\nIn the course of the war, Russian navy engaged Germany and Ottoman on two fronts. With the German fleet larger and more modern in the Baltic, the Russian navy played a defensive role, at most attacking German convoys and laying mines. The Black Sea was the domain of Russia with a large fleet based in Sevastopol, and it was led by two skilled commanders: Admiral Eberhart and Admiral Kolchak. The greatest loss suffered by the Black Sea fleet was the destruction of the battleship Imperatritsa Mariya, which blew up in port on 7 October 1916.\n\nEven though Russia in 1916 had the strength to launch the decisive Brusilov Offensive, it had already reached the breaking point when the famine and countless coffins from the frontline frustrated every Russian. With people losing faith in the Tsar's regime, there were large-scale protests in the capital region, forcing the Tsar to abdicate. This is known as the February Revolution."
 Naval_lore.13.t: "Soviet/Russian Navy: 1917-1936"
 Naval_lore.13.d: "Without a centralized power structure, the provisional government became unpopular immediately after it decided to continue the war on the Entente side. Although Russia's military forces were already crumbling, it still possessed a formidable size. Germany found that putting an end to the eastern front was necessary and launched massive offensives in Eastern Europe and the Gulf of Riga, trying to force Russia out of the war.\n\nThe high hopes felt across Russia following the February Revolution had diminished to almost nothing by the closing weeks of 1917. The Provisional Government’s ineffectual policies and weak authority in the face of the Petrograd Soviet had left the capital paralyzed with incessant street fighting and political turmoil. An attempted \"March on Petrograd\" by General Lavr Kornilov in August had demonstrated the army’s willingness to restore order, but President Alexander Kerensky had instead made the disastrous mistake of freeing the Bolsheviks to protect the city.\n\nDespite the conspiracy that Germany was behind the return of Vladimir Lenin, communism became quite popular among workers and soldiers, and finally led to the October Revolution and the brutal Russian Civil War.\n\nMost sailors sided with the Bolsheviks, and their ships remained in port due to shortage of fuel. With the communists controlling key industrial regions, the anti-Bolsheviks factions formed the White Army, but they were never united as a whole and were weak compared to the Red Army. However, after the assassination of Lenin, Germany started to send aid and personnel to the Whites fearing the exportation of Bolshevik revolution, which granted the Whites an edge over the Soviets. In 1920, the victorious White Army signed the Treaty of Minsk with Germany to re-ratify the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk right after the siege of Moscow, ending the 3-year civil war.\n\nThe Eastern European states of the former Russian Empire achieved their independence, and were absorbed into Germany's military alliance, the Reichspakt. With Sevastopol in the hand of Ukraine, it inherited quite a few combat ships of the Black Sea Fleet, including Imperatritsa Mariya- and Evstafi-class battleships, while a few destroyers were returned to Russian Republic.\n\nRussian navy experienced a period of shrinking throughout the 1920s, with most of the outdated ships scrapped or sold. It was reinforced with a few new warships, despite being backward compared to other naval powers'. The construction of two Izmail-class battlecruisers continued in mid-1925 with German assistance, while others were sold. Completed in 1928, the Izmails were the largest ships in the fleet and armed with twelve 356mm guns. The Svetlana-class were the first modern light cruisers built by Imperial Russia and 90% completed when they were towed from Tallin to St. Petersburg in 1917. The Soviets expected to commission them in 1919, but they were laid up incomplete due to the disruptions of the civil war, which later fell into the hand of White Army and were finished in 1927.\n\nIn 1936, despite a strong presence in the Baltic and the Black Sea, the Russian Navy had few ships in the Barents and Pacific region. It would still take years before the Russian Navy gets back to its original place." 
 
 AUS_naval_lore: "History of Austro-Hungarian Navy"
 Naval_lore.14.t: "k.u.k. Kriegsmarine: 1900-1920"
 Naval_lore.14.d: "The Kaiserliche und königliche Kriegsmarine, or in short k.u.k. Kriegsmarine, is one of the three branches of Habsburg military forces, and was not formally established until the 18th century. It had a long history of rivalry with Italian navy and took part in many battles in the War of Italian Independence.\n\nAs the dreadnought race raging between the United Kingdom and Germany, Austria and Italy were in a race of their own for domination of the Adriatic Sea. The Kriegsmarine had another prominent supporter at that time in the face of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Like other naval enthusiasts before him, Ferdinand had a keen private interest in the fleet and was an energetic campaigner for naval matters. Upon the completion of HMS Dreadnought, Austria's naval architects, aware of the inevitable dominance of dreadnought battleships, presented their case of Tegetthoff-class to the War Ministry. Among four ordered, three were finished before Weltkrieg with Szent István commissioned into the fleet in late-1915.\n\nThe fragile peace in Europe was ended by a shot ringing across Sarajevo and Archduke Ferdinand lying in his blood, it prompted the Empire to mobilize and send a strongly-worded ultimatum to Serbia, whose intelligence agency was believed to be behind the assassination. The tensions drew concerns from other powers and initiated a month of diplomatic manoeuvring, known as the July Crisis. Offered a blank check by Germany, Austria ignored Russia's warning and began shelling Belgrade on 28 July 1914, which marked the start of Weltkrieg.\n\nThe navy saw some action during the war, but prior to Italian entry spent much of its time in its major base at Pola, except for small skirmishes. While the surface fleet at most supported offensives on land with shore bombardments, the U-boat campaign on the Mediterranean Sea was such a success that it forced the Entente to deploy hundreds of naval drifters armed with depth charges to block the Otranto Strait. In 1917, Capitan Miklós Horthy led an assualt on the Otranto Barrage to break the blockade with a fleet of cruisers and destroyers, which ended surprisingly in Austria's favour with sinking two enemy destroyers and many armed drifters. The second attempt happened in June 1918 under the command of Horthy, a Rear Admiral then. However, the mission was doomed when the fleet was by chance spotted by an Italian MAS boat, culminating in the destruction of an Austrian dreadnought, SMS Szent István. With the whole western front breaking down in late-1918, Italy decided to do one last push. On 1 November 1918, two Italian sailors attacked the anchored Viribus Unitis with a manned torpedo but failed to sink it.\n\nDespite standing amongst the victors of the Weltkrieg, the war revealed the divisions of culture, class, and ideology within the Empire ever so clearly. Austria struggled in the first few years to put down inner unrests and restore orders in its military occupied zones of Northern Italy and Ukraine. The naval modernization was hampered due to those distractions, with only one Admiral Njegovan-class cruiser, an improved version of Helgoland originated from the Ersatz Zenta project, laid in 1919.\n\nTrailing far behind other naval powers, the Austro-Hungarian Empire almost stagnated in terms of battleships, making it an insignificant player in the midst of the Second Naval Arms Race."
 Naval_lore.15.t: "k.u.k. Kriegsmarine: 1920-1936"
 Naval_lore.15.d: "As tensions cooled down a little bit in the early 1920s, Kaiser Karl, following in the footsteps of the assassinated Franz Ferdinand, began trying to reform the multinational Austro-Hungarian Empire into something that could survive in the twentieth century, launched a series of large-scale reforms. The federalization met resistance from the nobility of Hungary, and was also affected by autonomy movements in Cisleithanian region, leading to Kaiser's plan progressing slowly.\n\nThe Kriegsmarine, in the face of severe finicial state, stayed away from the heating naval race between the UK and Germany. It instead focused on screen ships and submarines based on the strategic consideration that large ships were proved to be inefficient for battles in narrow waters such as the Mediterranean. Eight Dragoner-class destroyers, known as the Ersatz Huszár, were ordered in 1922 as a part of the naval rearmament program. Displacing 1,700 tons, it carried two twin 12cm guns and three triple 45cm torpedo tubes.\n\nDespite the internal debate over usefulness of battleships, the navy still found it necessary to update its fleet of merely three old dreadnoughts. Early in 1914, the government had approved to build four battleships for 1915-1918 naval program at the request of Anton Haus, Commander-in-Chief of the navy. Designed as the Ersatz Monarch, the constrcution of the four battleships, later Hunyadi-class, was suspended during the war as the government canceled all naval contracts. Although they were so close to be scrapped, Haus objected to a cancellation of the project and in February 1915 a compromise was reached where construction would be halted until after the war. Finished in 1923, they were originally armed with ten 350mm guns and refitted with eight 380mm guns in 1929. Austria's further effort to develop battleships was doomed after the Hungarian parliament refused to finance their share of the naval budget, forcing the navy to look for cheaper designs such as battlecruisers. The resulting Schwarzenberg-class was largely based on Hunyadi but faster, fitting ten 350mm guns in two triple turrets and two twin turrets. Two of them were completed in 1932, while the funding of another two just started in late-1934.\n\nWith the growing Communal naval strength in the Mediterranean, Austria felt threatened that it might face another blockade during the coming war if the French couldn't be overwhelmed. Four Meteor-class destroyers were ordered in the 1930s to accompany the Custozza-class cruisers which was capable of long operations and able to fight new generation of cruisers. To cripple the Commune's economy at wartime, a squadron of new submarines were built applying licensed German technologies. Quiter than any submarines before, the U-120 class was made to operate in shallow waters, extremely lethal to the convoys on the surface.\n\nAs tensions mounting in Europe, Austria was vigilant to a nearing German-Franco conflict, while its old enemies were also making strength for the revenge. Although the Kriegsmarine was often neglected, it still remained as an important part of national defense for the Austro-Hungarian Empire in these uncertain times."
