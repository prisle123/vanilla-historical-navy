 ship_rocket_artillery: "Rocket Artillery"
 ship_rocket_artillery_desc: "Recent advance in rocket science has not only resolved its shortage of range, but has also made rocket artillery more affordable to mass production. Witnessing its success in land warfare, efforts are made to combine this powerful weapon with warships. The ship rocket artillery uses rockets without any guidance device. Despite poor accuracy, they can deal considerable damage to the object even without a direct hit. Meanwhile, the invention of proximity fuze has helped offset its weakness."
 
 advanced_sonar: "Towed Sonar Array"
 advanced_sonar_desc: "Towed sonar is also known as variable depth sonar. It can operate in deeper waters to avoid the interference of ship noise.\n\nMounting this module in an §YElectronics Slot§! on §YLight Ships§! or §YCruisers§! will help them detect enemy §YSubmarines§!."
 naval_radio_guiding_system: "Naval Radio Guiding System"
 naval_radio_guiding_system_desc: "The idea of controlling objects remotely predates the invention of radio, but radio guidance exploits its feature of long-range transmission and makes the process wireless. Compared to inertial and preset guidance methods, radio guidance is more conducive to attacking moving ships by taking location of the target into consideration."
 ship_to_ship_missile: "Radio-Guided Missile"
 ship_to_ship_missile_desc: "Based on antecedent breakthoughs in radio guided weapons, the radio guidance technology has become the last piece of puzzle in making a self-driven weapon to send powerful payloads from a long distance accurately. Either guided by remote or internal radio source, anti-ship missile is way more effective than conventional artillery and has attarcted most nations in the world to fill their arsenals with it."
 high_speed_light_engine: "High-Pressure Boiler"
 high_speed_light_engine_desc: "The ultra-high pressure boiler with superheaters can provide a stronger power of about 75,000 hp for the steam turbine. However, due to its unstable performance, it is currently only used on small ships such as destroyers."
 large_destroyer_trend: "Large Destroyer"
 large_destroyer_trend_desc: "A flotilla leader is a warship suitable for commanding a flotilla of destroyers or other small warships, typically a small cruiser or a large destroyer. Originally, the role was usually played by light cruisers or scout cruisers, but the rapid growth of destroyers in the early 1900s has made these vessels obsolete and incapable of keeping pace with faster destroyers. The new dynamics at sea prompt navies to build dedicated large destroyers to replace them.\n\nInstall §YDestroyer Leader Role§! on §YLight Hull§! to strengthen §YLight Attack§!."
 escort_destroyer_trend: "Escort Destroyer"
 escort_destroyer_trend_desc: "During the Second World War, the emergence of new submarines posed a major threat to the merchant fleets. As a large number of destroyers were occupied on the frontline, the demand for an economical and flexible light destroyer became urgent. Escort destroyers have been stripped of most unnecessary equipments, retaining only basic guns and depth charges, any naval power can build numerous ships of this type within a few months. With sonars, these little guys active on the ocean route have become an important factor in the country's war potential.\n\nInstall §YEscort Destroyer Role§! on §YLight Hull§! to reduce §YCost§!."
 destroyer_mass_production: "Destroyer Mass Production"
 destroyer_mass_production_desc: "Violent battles have led to losses of destroyers, so great that even the naval powers with hundreds of them before the war can hardly bear. To sustain continuous fleet operations, the new generation of destroyers have adopted a mass production method, shortening the time from keel to ship."
 sound_surveillance_system: "SOSUS"
 sound_surveillance_system_desc: "SOSUS, or Sound Surveillance System, is an anti-submarine surveillance network formed by a large number of passive sonars. Its construction requires building monitoring stations on islands and shores. Advanced sonar array deployed at these sites can track submarines in the area through SOFAR (Sound Fixing And Ranging Channel) at which depth the speed of sound is at its minimum. The system can also be used for scientific research including hydrology, geography and marine biology."
 destroyer_missile_upgrade: "Anti-Air Missile Destroyer Refit"
 destroyer_missile_upgrade_desc: "During World War II, efforts were started to develop surface-to-air missiles as it was generally considered that flak was of little use against bombers of ever-increasing performance. The research was led by several major powers in the world, and they quickly developed a great amount of types. Modified upon land-based SAM system, the ship-to-air missile system saw dedicated improvements in its guiding and launching modules.\n\nInstall §YAnti-Air Destroyer Role§! on §YLight Hull§! to unlock §YSurface-to-Air Missiles§!."
 
 early_cruiser_armor: "Great War Cruiser Armor"
 early_cruiser_armor_desc: "By the 1890s, it had become a general consensus that cruisers with armor protection had better survivability and would ultimately replace unprotected cruisers.\n\nMounting this module on §YCruisers§! improves their ability to §Ywithstand enemy damage§!, but also §Rreduces§! their §Yspeed§!."
 basic_cruiser_armor: "Interwar Cruiser Armor"
 basic_cruiser_armor_desc: "The restriction on displacement of cruisers made by Washington Naval Treaty in the 1920s promoted the naval designers to adopt ideas, such as inclined armor, to save the tonnage. Newly designed cruisers generally had moderate armor, which could resist shells from old rapid-fire guns.\n\nMounting this module on §YCruisers§! improves their ability to §Ywithstand enemy damage§!, but also §Rreduces§! their §Yspeed§!."
 improved_cruiser_armor: "Improved Cruiser Armor"
 improved_cruiser_armor_desc: "With looming tensions across the world, the Washington System was crumbling when Japan and Italy refused to sign the Second London Naval Treaty, and both started to build cruisers exceeding the restriction. The cruiser armor has emerged thicker and harder as the times require.\n\nMounting this module on §YCruisers§! improves their ability to §Ywithstand enemy damage§!, but also §Rreduces§! their §Yspeed§!."
 advanced_cruiser_armor: "Advanced Cruiser Armor"
 advanced_cruiser_armor_desc: "Experience gained in the war has further promoted the development of cruiser. Besides heavy armor, the new cruisers also adopted an armor layout design similar to that of the battleship. While maintaining a high speed, it allocated more tonnage to the defense of key parts.\n\nMounting this module on §YCruisers§! improves their ability to §Ywithstand enemy damage§!, but also §Rreduces§! their §Yspeed§!."
 searchlight: "Searchlight"
 searchlight_desc: "Searchlight is generally installed on the side of ships for reconnaissance at night and navigation in foggy weather. Although a better field of vision can be obtained, it may expose the ship's position if used recklessly."
 treaty_cruiser_trend: "Treaty Cruiser"
 treaty_cruiser_trend_desc: "With the concern that a subsequent race in building larger, more powerful cruisers might subvert the usefulness of the prohibition on capital ship construction, representatives of the United States, Great Britain, Japan, France and Italy set limits on the tonnage and firepower of cruisers to 10,000 tons in standard displacement and 8 inches for maximum main gun caliber, further solidating the modern definition of cruiser."
 colony_cruiser: "Colonial Cruiser"
 colony_cruiser_desc: "To guard their vast colonies, the colonial empires always take range and cost into consideration of cruiser designs. Colonial cruiser is not a specific class of cruiser, but it has features including low cost, speed advantage and good seaworthiness. Deployed far from the heart of the empires, it is more than sufficient to maintain a relatively strong naval presence even at the edge of the world.\n\nInstall §YColonial Cruiser Role§! on §YCruiser Hull§! to reduce §YCost§!."
 cruiser_gun_upgrade: "Cruiser Semi-Autoloader"
 cruiser_gun_upgrade_desc: "Facing stronger performance of destroyers in the 1930s, rapid-fire guns developed before the war can no longer meet the need. To ensure efficiency against destroyers, cruisers are equipped with mechanical loading machines that increase rate of fire while saving manpower. Although the machine still requires manual assistance, it can achieve a loading efficiency far exceeding that of non-autoloading guns."
 cruiser_aa_upgrade: "Anti-Air Cruiser Refit"
 cruiser_aa_upgrade_desc: "By the 1930s, carrier-based aircrafts have seen great progress in manoeuverability and payload. Some naval officers see this as a chance to promote the role of aircraft carrier in future naval warfare. To counter it, most ships are reinforced with better anti-air firepower, and constructions of dedicated anti-air cruisers start simultaneously.\n\nInstall §YAnti-Air Cruiser Role§! on §YCruiser Hull§! to strengthen §YAnti-Air Attack§!."
 destroyer_cruiser_trend: "Super Destroyer"
 destroyer_cruiser_trend_desc: "As a by-product of differentiation strategy to cope with larger destroyers, a new ship class with features from both light cruiser and destroyer has emerged. Equipped with intermediate armaments including lesser cruiser-level guns, its definition varies across the world. It can play the role of flotilla leader in a small squadron, and destroyer killer when acting alone, which its speed advantage also allows it to fight an unsymmetrical war at sea.\n\nInstall §YSuper Destroyer Role§! on §YLight Hull§! to unlock §YLight Medium Battery§!."
 cruiser_radar_sentry: "Radar Picket Refit"
 cruiser_radar_sentry_desc: "The advent of radar has completely changed reconnaissance in naval battle that even the most trained observer cannot match its range or accuracy. Cruisers, usually acting as the vanguard of fleet, become the first naval ships to install radars. With radar's unparalleled detection range, it allows the fleet to spot enemy earlier than before.\n\nInstall §YRadar Picket Role§! on §YCruiser Hull§! to strengthen §YSurface Detection§!."
 fighter_directional_system: "Fighter Directional System"
 fighter_directional_system_desc: "The predecessor of the ship-controlled interception system is the ground-controlled joint interception tactics developed in the war. By connecting multiple radar stations to the joint control center, the headquarter can issue more specific information on position and speed of enemy aircrafts to fighters. Upon the advance of ship radars, this system is also used in naval operations, making interception carried out by carrier fighters more efficient."
 cruiser_missile_upgrade: "Missile Cruiser Refit"
 cruiser_missile_upgrade_desc: "Missile is not only powerful but also more accurate, thus rendering naval guns useless in its face. Although battleship can utilize its ample space to install missiles, cruiser must go through total conversion in order to accommodate their launchers and storages.\n\nInstall §YMissile Cruiser Role§! on §YCruiser Hull§! to unlock §YAnti-Ship Missile§!."
 helipad: "Helipad"
 helipad_desc: "The idea of helicopter was invented way before the 20th century, but hundreds of them were first built and deployed in the war during the Second World War. At first, helicopters were used in small numbers for observation, transport, and medical evacuation. As vertical flight can save more space on a narrow deck of ship, navy has also seen this breakthrough as a perfect replenishment for seaplanes. But before turboshaft is invented, helicopters only play a very limited role in naval opearations."
 
 basic_heavy_armor: "Interwar Heavy Armor"
 basic_heavy_armor_desc: "After the end of Great War, capital ships began to adopt thicker armor to cope with the rapid advancement of naval guns. The armor belts of front-line battleships could usually reach a thickness of more than 300 mm, which was able to basically defend against the shooting of main guns built during the war.\n\nMounting this module on §YHeavy Ships§! improves their ability to §Ywithstand enemy damage§!. §YBattleships§! and §YBattlecruisers§! are defined by their different §YArmors§!."
 improved_heavy_armor: "Improved Heavy Armor"
 improved_heavy_armor_desc: "In the 1930s, inclined armor was applied on the newly designed capital ships. Despite a slightly inferior thickness, it could achieve a similar level of protection as thicker vertical armor.\n\nMounting this module on §YHeavy Ships§! improves their ability to §Ywithstand enemy damage§!. §YBattleships§! and §YBattlecruisers§! are defined by their different §YArmors§!."
 advanced_heavy_armor: "Advanced Heavy Armor"
 advanced_heavy_armor_desc: "The new heavy armor designed in the Second World War applied the latest steel-manufacturing technology. The new steel is stronger and more resilient, and will not crack under the oblique shooting of some armor-piercing shells.\n\nMounting this module on §YHeavy Ships§! improves their ability to §Ywithstand enemy damage§!. §YBattleships§! and §YBattlecruisers§! are defined by their different §YArmors§!."
 
 incremental_armor_scheme: "Post-Jutland Armor Scheme"
 incremental_armor_scheme_desc: "The Battle of Jutland has proved armor layout before 1914 incompetent. Lacking awareness of the long combat distance, the armor of previous battleships generally lacked the ability to resist 15-inch naval guns. The new armor scheme developed after that was also known as the post-Jutland scheme. It was just a temporary design strengthening the deck armor, and soon became obsolete after the war.\n\nInstall §YArmor Scheme§! on §YHeavy Hull§! to strengthen §YArmor§! or §YHP§!."
 mixed_armor_scheme: "Mixed Armor Scheme"
 mixed_armor_scheme_desc: "The mixed scheme was a transitional armor scheme after the war, which mainly integrated lessons learned from Jutland and the idea of all-or-nothing defense. Compared with the incremental scheme invented 20 years ago, it had a better armor ratio in some areas that are highly vulnerable.\n\nInstall §YArmor Scheme§! on §YHeavy Hull§! to strengthen §YArmor§! or §YHP§!."
 all_or_nothing_armor_scheme: "All-or-Nothing Armor Scheme"
 all_or_nothing_armor_scheme_desc: "The all-or-nothing scheme was first adopted on the Nevada-class battleships, and has been applied on all US battleships after that. The all-or-nothing design greatly saves the armor of non-essential areas with the same tonnage, and uses armored citadel to protect the fragile magazine and main engine. Ships with this type of armor scheme usually have better survivability.\n\nInstall §YArmor Scheme§! on §YHeavy Hull§! to strengthen §YArmor§! or §YHP§!."
 all_or_nothing_armor_box_armor_scheme: "Enhanced All-or-Nothing Armor Scheme"
 all_or_nothing_armor_box_armor_scheme_desc: "During the Second World War, the research on battleship armor went to a higher level that all-or-nothing scheme was widely used, prompting a series of shells with stronger armor piercing effect. The secondary armor box works as a part to enhance overall strength of the ship while protecting secondary areas such as crew quarters.\n\nInstall §YArmor Scheme§! on §YHeavy Hull§! to strengthen §YArmor§! or §YHP§!."
 harvey_steel: "Harvey Steel"
 harvey_steel_desc: "Harvey armor was a type of steel armor developed by American engineer Hayward Harvey in the early 1890s. It was once popular and saw several main producers of the armor plate including Vickers, Krupp and Bethlehem."
 krupp_steel: "Krupp Armor"
 krupp_steel_desc: "Krupp armor was invented by Germany's Krupp Arm Works in 1893 and replaced Harvey armor as a primary method of protecting naval ships. The manufacturing of Krupp armor was very similar to Harveyized armor, but the Krupp process, instead of generally using nickel-steel, added as much as 1% chromium to the alloy for additional hardness. Early ballistic tests showed that 260mm of Krupp armor offered the same protection as 300mm of Harvey armor."
 krupp_cemented_steel: "Krupp Cemented Armor"
 krupp_cemented_steel_desc: "The manufacturing process of Krupp cemented armor (KCA) remained largely the same as original Krupp steel armor, with slight changes in the alloy composition. The KCA retained the hardened surface via the application of carbonized gases but also had a much greater fibrous elasticity on the rear of the plate, which greatly reduced the incidence of spalling and cracking under incoming fire."
 ducol_steel: "Ducol Steel"
 ducol_steel_desc: "Ducol or D-steel is the name of a number of high-strength low-alloy steels of varying composition, first developed from the early 1920s by the Scottish firm of David Colville & Sons. Applications have included ship hull construction, light armoring and pressure vessels such as locomotive steam boilers."
 homogeneous_krupp_steel: "Homogeneous Krupp Armor"
 homogeneous_krupp_steel_desc: "Developments in face-hardened armor in the late 19th and early 20th centuries revealed that such armor was less effective against glancing oblique impacts. The hardened face layer's brittleness was counterproductive against such impacts. The new invention of homogeneous steel combined ductility and tensile strength, and was typically used for deck and waterline protection."
 
 basic_torpedo_defense: "Early Torpedo Defense System"
 basic_torpedo_defense_desc: "A torpedo fired by a torpedo boat that costs less than one percent of a battleship can cause the same damage as a naval heavy gun hits, or even deadlier. The battleships during the Great War installed torpedo defense systems one after another to resist such threat. By separating more watertight compartments inside the hull, the effect of taking in water was balanced. Similar efforts included torpedo bulges, which were filled with liquid to maximize absorption from underwater blasts.\n\nInstall §YTorpedo Defense System§! on §YHeavy Hull§! to reduce §RTorpedo Damage§!."
 improved_torpedo_defense: "Improved Torpedo Defense System"
 improved_torpedo_defense_desc: "The power of new torpedoes has far exceeded those of the past. To make up for the shortcomings of the Great War torpedo defense system, armor was put behind areas that are vulnerable to torpedo attacks, and together with the torpedo bulkheads, they can resist some impacts from torpedoes.\n\nInstall §YTorpedo Defense System§! on §YHeavy Hull§! to reduce §RTorpedo Damage§!."
 advanced_torpedo_defense: "Advanced Torpedo Defense System"
 advanced_torpedo_defense_desc: "The latest torpedo defense system tries to protect the hull from torpedoes by separating more watertight compartments, which can ensure buoyancy of the ship is not affected. Moreover, improvement of the armor manufacturing process has also strengthened the torpedo belt.\n\nInstall §YTorpedo Defense System§! on §YHeavy Hull§! to reduce §RTorpedo Damage§!."
 enhanced_horizontal_defense: "Deck Armoring"
 enhanced_horizontal_defense_desc: "Although it was not widely realized in the past, the parabolic trajectory from long distance is one of the most common ways to hit a maneuvering ship from another. After studying outcomes of the battle at Jutland, naval powers all chose to strengthen battleship's deck armor."
 heavy_ship_refit_reduction: "Obsolete Ship Refit"
 heavy_ship_refit_reduction_desc: "The Naval Holiday has largely paused every country's shipbuilding efforts. To improve the fleet under strict observation, modernizing old ships had become an efficient and economical approach."
 dry_dock_expansion: "Dry Dock Expansion"
 dry_dock_expansion_desc: "As the scale of battleship projects escalating immediately after the Great War, dockyards for dreadnoughts could no longer fulfill the mission. To accommodate the huge hulls, shipbuilding enterprises decided to expand their dry docks built in the early 20th century.\nAlthough these super battleships were never launched, docks remained active with capability of providing maintenance to a large ship or multiple small ships at the same time."
 improved_conning_tower: "Improved Conning Tower"
 improved_conning_tower_desc: "The conning tower is the core of a battleship. In past wars, it has always assumed duties like command, reconnaissance and fire control. The development of naval guns has an interactive influence on its evolution. Once without enough armoring, the integrated and enclosed bridge can provide better protection for commanding personnel, and at the same time create plenty of room for the communication department."
 fuel_oil_boiler: "Oil Boiler"
 fuel_oil_boiler_desc: "Fuel oil is a heavy oil remaining after the process of extracting gasoline or diesel from crude oil, which is very viscous and difficult to volatilize. Due to its high calorific value, fuel oil can be burned more fully, providing stronger power for ships, while producing less smoke than coal-powered boilers."
 ship_living_standard: "Ship Living Standard Improvement"
 ship_living_standard_desc: "The living environment aboard was very harsh, but this situation is gradually improving. More countries begin to use iron beds and air-conditioning systems on warships to ensure the fighting will and physical condition of sailors in peacetime, so that they can devote themselves to the battle in a fuller state.\nMoreover, from tonkatsu (fried pork chop) and curry rice in Japan to macaroni and ice cream in US, food on ships is getting even better, though the best is still reserved for officers. \n\n§CLet the army envy us!§!"
 rudder_upgrade: "Rudder Upgrade"
 rudder_upgrade_desc: "Improved rudder gear allows ship to turn flexibly, which provides a better maneuvering ability in formation and retreat."
 battleship_aa_upgrade: "Battleship Anti-Air Upgrade"
 battleship_aa_upgrade_desc: "Surprising results made by aircraft carriers in the war have pushed the naval powers to shift their attention from large but slow battle fleet to carrier battle group, a move that seems to deteriorate the role of battleships in the fleet. However, carrier is still considered vulnerable without protection from battleship, whose size provides a platform for anti-air defense. Battleships equipped with a large number of anti-air guns have emerged alongside carriers as escorts."
 fuel_tank_upgrade: "Large Fuel Tank"
 fuel_tank_upgrade_desc: "The standard for building a global navy is that the country's fleet can be deployed far away from its sphere of influence under any circumstances, and effectively implement deterrence locally. Having larger fuel tanks on our ships can help achieve this goal."
 radar_jammer: "Radar Jammer"
 radar_jammer_desc: "The invention of radar has greatly facilitated the ability to locate air targets, which is crucial in naval warfare. A series of interference technologies are developed to counter it. Interference was initially achieved by throwing metal chaff and other passive methods. Now the clutter jammer can release noise in radar's operating frequency, making it more difficult to locate us."
 combat_information_center: "Combat Information Center"
 combat_information_center_desc: "The combat information center, or CIC, is the heart of a warship. At the end of the war, the most advanced naval ships had all types of electronic devices installed including search radar, anti-air radar and fire control system. The past conning tower no longer met the requirement. CIC integrated every control unit of the electronic systems aboard, with aid from computers, it could provide the captain or fleet commander with faster and more detailed information."
 
 prototype_airplane_launcher: "Prototype Airplane Launcher"
 prototype_airplane_launcher_desc: "The ship airplane launcher, inveneted by Britain, uses hydraulic pressure to eject light seaplanes from ships with limited space, and then recovers them with a crane at the tail. Some countries have experimented with seaplanes during the Great War and proved their power, but with the increasing size of aircrafts, conventional catapult can no longer sustain effective combat payload of the plane, which eventually inspires aircraft carrier in the future."
 early_carrier_study: "Carrier Study"
 early_carrier_study_desc: "Equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft, the carrier fulfilled the need to launch air raids from the sea. Before the advent of the first carrier, there were various studies made by different leading countries in aero industry, which laid a solid foundation for those latecomers."
 landing_aid_system: "Landing Aid System"
 landing_aid_system_desc: "Landing of carrier-based aircraft is the most dangerous subject in carrier operations. Despite bearing a title of \"system\", the landing aid operations were mostly carried out by people known as landing signal officers (LSO). They were sometimes served by experienced pilots, and used a set of semaphores with colored paddles to help pilots adjust landing attitude."
 arresting_gear: "Arresting Gear"
 arresting_gear_desc: "The landing arrestment system is an auxiliary equipment used on flight deck that achieves safe landing of aircraft. As the most important part of this device, arresting gear catches tailhook of the plane with a high-strength rope. If it fails, barricade will become the last measure."
 aviation_dawn: "Aviation Dawn"
 aviation_dawn_desc: "From Wright Flyer to monoplane nowadays, aircraft has been through many revolutions with stronger and corrosion-resistant materials, which the improvements bring it with a more critical role in fleet operations. Navies of Japan, Britain and US have organized a large number of exercises at the turn of the 1930s, culminating in a series of advancements in naval and air tactics. Due to its heavy reliance on cutting-edge technologies and seasoned personnel, a functional naval aviation force must go through lots of practices.\n\nYet it is not easy for any country possessing a large battleship fleet to change the course. Resistance from vested interests is expected.\n\n§RThe age of airplanes is here, guns and armors were the past......§!"
 carrier_radio_range: "Navigation Radio Range"
 carrier_radio_range_desc: "As aircraft becomes heavier and flies farther, a major challenge has emerged: how can pilots reliably find their moving carrier at sea after a mission. The answer is found in revolutional breakthrough of radio homing technology, which the carrier transmits radio signals on a specific frequency, acting as a beacon to guide fighter aircrafts with receivers back to the ship. The technology allows for safer recovery in poor weather, extended operational range, and is crucial for coordinating large-scale attacks in a durative war."
 dive_bomber_study: "Dive Bomber Study"
 dive_bomber_study_desc: "Unlike torpedo bombers, dive bombers attack from high altitude, making them harder for fighters or anti-air guns to intercept. Additionally, diving directly at its targets provides greater accuracy for the bomb, and simplifies the bomb's trajectory to allow the pilot to keep visual contact throughout the bomb run. The agility also ensures that they can attack and escape at high speed, increasing survivability while rendering evasive maneuvers by the target ineffective."
 carrier_mass_production: "Carrier Mass Production"
 carrier_mass_production_desc: "Needs from ongoing war and deeper understanding of construction methods made call for shorter period of building carriers. Welding, pre-assembled sections, and standardized designs have all contributed to the rapid growth of construction efficiency."
 escort_carriers_ship: "Escort Carrier"
 escort_carriers_ship_desc: "Rampant threats from submarines during the war have made protection on convoys the key to victory. Unlike fleet carrier, escort carrier is cheaper and faster to produce. It excels in anti-submarine warfare and providing air cover, making them ideal for securing trade routes"
 folding_wing: "Folding Wing"
 folding_wing_desc: "It is becoming even more evident what decisive role that aircrafts can play in recent battles. To achieven better capacity on carriers, aircraft designers start to apply folding wings on the latest naval planes, trying to save hangar and deck space, whose manufacture requires superb craftsmanship."
 carrier_damage_control: "Integrated Damage Control"
 carrier_damage_control_desc: "Damage control is the emergency control of situations that may cause the sinking of a watercraft. Navies of western countries have long been aware of the importance of a professional firefighting and repair team. The lessons learned from war have only made it more pronounced, especially for carriers, the primary naval assets.\nThe damage control department consists of not only the men but also devices including fire extinguishers and fire-retardant fuel tanks."
 air_fuel_storage: "Air Fuel Storage"
 air_fuel_storage_desc: "More extensive carrier opearations during the Second World War have made the need for large fuel tanks even more pronounced, because the quantity of air fuel aboard is positively related to range and payload of aircrafts.\nMore air fuel carried usually means the carrier can support more air groups efficiently.\n\nAir fuel storage can help §Ycarrier-based aircrafts§! improve §Yrange§! and §Yagility§!."
 full_armored_carrier: "Enclosed Armored Carrier"
 full_armored_carrier_desc: "Britain was the first to adopt armored flight decks on carriers, which their armor could prevent dive bombing from damaging the deck in combat. This idea has become widely accepted by other naval powers by the end of the war, contributing to modern carriers featuring enclosed hangar and armored flight deck."
 carrier_steam_catapult: "CATOBAR"
 carrier_steam_catapult_desc: "Even the state-of-the-art propeller fighter was quickly rendered obsolete by jet plane at the end of the war. Since its weight has been greatly increased by usage of advanced materials, it is unable to take off from decks with limited length. Some naval designers proposed connecting the steam turbine to the catapult, so that jet fighters can be launched to reach a faster initial speed. Such system is called CATOBAR, or \"Catapult Assisted Take-Off Barrier Arrested Recovery\""
 carrier_angled_deck: "Angled Flight Deck"
 carrier_angled_deck_desc: "The angled deck first appeared in the late 1940s and it is usually located on the left side of the flight deck, forming an angle of 6 to 13 degrees with the centerline. The entire flight deck is divided into two areas, allowing the carrier to perform take-off and landing operations at the same time, which greatly improves the sortie efficiency."
 vnr_ship_hull_super_carrier: "Super Carrier Hull"
 vnr_ship_hull_super_carrier_desc: "As the war draws to an end, the superiority of carrier has made it bear the weight of high hopes from naval theorists. Mature technologies like enclosed hangar, armored flight deck, and new innovations such as angled deck and steam catapult, become essential parts on a modern carrier, allowing it to hold over a hundred aircrafts. Due to its enormous size, carrier of this type is usually referred as supercarrier."
 
 acoustic_signature: "Acoustic Signature Study"
 acoustic_signature_desc: "Acoustic signature is used to describe a combination of acoustic emissions of sound emitters, such as those of ships and submarines. Through large-scale spying and surveillance operations during peacetime, the acoustic signatures of warships are collected and included in recognition manuals, and later distributed to sonar operators to identify enemy ships during the war."
 teardrop_hull: "Teardrop Hull"
 teardrop_hull_desc: "A teardrop hull is a submarine hull design which emphasizes submerged performance over surfaced performance. It was somewhat commonly used in the early stages of submarine development, but was gradually abandoned in the early 20th century in favour of designs optimized for high performance on the surface as a result of changes in operational doctrine. Despite that, the technology still had a profound impact in future designs of submarines."
 diesel_electric_transmission: "Diesel-Electric Transmission"
 diesel_electric_transmission_desc: "Before the invention of ship diesel engine, attempts to drive submarines with kerosene and gasoline all failed due to their high volatility. To extend submarine's submersion time, the diesel-electric power system was introduced. It is composed of diesel engine, electric engine, generator, and storage battery. The diesel engine is used on the surface, powering the generator, while the electric engine is for underwater scenario with little oxygen from air."
 basic_periscope: "Basic Periscope"
 basic_periscope_desc: "Periscopes have been used as early as 1906 on Germany's first submarine, which can observe the situation on the water without surfacing."
 improved_periscope: "Improved Periscope"
 improved_periscope_desc: "Improved prisms and lenses are used in the manufacturing of new periscopes, this will achieve better imaging effects and facilitate the captain to observe enemy targets."
 advanced_periscope: "Advanced Periscope"
 advanced_periscope_desc: "New technology focuses on solving the vibration problem of periscopes when the submarine is sailing. With the additional mast bracket, even if the submarine sails at a speed of 6-8 knots, its periscope will not be affected by the waves. Another improvement is the increased watertightness, an upgrade that protects the optics from impact of depth charge blast."
 basic_ballast_tank: "Basic Ballast Tank"
 basic_ballast_tank_desc: "The ballast tank is a cabin where ballast water is placed, and is used to adjust the center of gravity, buoyancy and stability of the ship. On a submarine, the ballast tank determines the speed of the submarine's submersion and ascent, and plays a decisive role in its tactics."
 improved_ballast_tank: "Improved Ballast Tank"
 improved_ballast_tank_desc: "The newly designed ballast tank uses technologies including a more reliable water pump and a filter to prevent impurities in the water from entering the water tank, which effectively improves its durability."
 advanced_torpedo_ballistics: "Advanced Torpedo Ballistics"
 advanced_torpedo_ballistics_desc: "Submarines during the Great War applied hand-held slide rules or mechanical calculator to assist torpedo ballistic calculation, which relied on the operator's numeracy and was poor in precision. With breakthroughs in hydrodynamics and torpedo propulsion, and experiments on torpedo movements in different hydro environments, it has greatly advanced submarine tactics in terms of attacking."
 torpedo_loader: "Torpedo Loader"
