 ship_rocket_artillery: "Rocket Artillery"
 ship_rocket_artillery_desc: "The development of rocket science has promoted the emergence of rockets. Other than application in land warfare, the navy was also trying to combine this powerful weapon with warships. Rocket artillery used rockets without guidance devices. Although the accuracy was poor, they would cause irreparable damage to the object once hit. At the same time, the development of proximity fuzes could also make up for the accuracy problem to a certain extent."
 
 advanced_sonar: "Towed Sonar Array"
 advanced_sonar_desc: "Towed sonar is also known as variable depth sonar. It can operate in deeper waters to avoid the interference of ship noise.\n\nMounting this module in an §YElectronics Slot§! on §YLight Ships§! or §YCruisers§! will help them detect enemy §YSubmarines§!."
 naval_radio_guiding_system: "Naval Radio Guiding System"
 naval_radio_guiding_system_desc: "After the radio was originally used for communication and radar ranging, it has developed the function of remote control in late-war times. The navy has also begun to adopt a guidance system based on radio signals on the latest equipment. Compared with inertial and preset guidance methods, radio guidance has also taken the location of target into consideration, which is more conducive to attacking moving ships."
 ship_to_ship_missile: "Radio-Guided Anti-Ship Missile"
 ship_to_ship_missile_desc: "An early anti-ship missile guided by radio, it has extremely high speed and can cause great damage. However, to carry its huge missile body, a special launcher is required, and not all warships are capable of installing it."
 high_speed_light_engine: "High-Pressure Boiler"
 high_speed_light_engine_desc: "The newly invented ultra-high pressure boiler can provide a stronger power of about 75,000 hp for the steam turbine, thereby greatly increasing the speed of ships. However, due to its unstable performance, the high-speed steam turbine is currently only used on small ships such as destroyers."
 large_destroyer_trend: "Large Destroyer"
 large_destroyer_trend_desc: "A flotilla leader was a warship suitable for commanding a flotilla of destroyers or other small warships, typically a small cruiser or a large destroyer. Originally, older light or scout cruisers were often used, but in the early 1900s, the rapidly increasing speed of new destroyer designs meant that such vessels could no longer keep pace with their charges. Accordingly, large destroyer designs were produced for use as leaders.\n\nInstall §YDestroyer Leader Role§! on §YLight Hull§! to strengthen §YLight Attack§!."
 escort_destroyer_trend: "Escort Destroyer"
 escort_destroyer_trend_desc: "During the Second World War, the emergence of new submarines posed a major threat to the merchant fleets. As a large number of destroyers were pinned down on the battlefield, the demand for an economical and flexible light destroyer became urgent. Escort destroyers have been stripped of most unnecessary equipments, retaining only basic guns and depth charges, any naval power can build numerous ships of this type within a few months. With sonars, these little guys active on the ocean route have become an important factor in the country's war potential.\n\nInstall §YEscort Destroyer Role§! on §YLight Hull§! to reduce §YCost§!."
 destroyer_mass_production: "Destroyer Mass Production"
 destroyer_mass_production_desc: "The large-scale battles on the front line led to great losses of destroyers, which even the naval powers with hundreds of destroyers before the war could hardly bear. To ensure the efficiency of fleet operation, the new generation of destroyers adopts an easy-to-produce mode, and the time from laying the keel to launching is greatly shortened."
 sound_surveillance_system: "SOSUS"
 sound_surveillance_system_desc: "SOSUS, or Sound Surveillance System, was an anti-submarine surveillance network formed by a large number of passive sonars. The construction of such system required building monitoring stations on islands and shores, and the advanced sonar array could track submarines in this area through SOFAR (Sound Fixing And Ranging Channel) at which depth the speed of sound is at its minimum. The system could also be used for scientific research including hydrology, geography and marine biology."
 destroyer_missile_upgrade: "Anti-Air Missile Destroyer Refit"
 destroyer_missile_upgrade_desc: "During World War II, efforts were started to develop surface-to-air missiles as it was generally considered that flak was of little use against bombers of ever-increasing performance. The research was led by several major powers in the world and quickly developed a great amount of types. As land-based SAM system being deployed, it was modified to fit in the naval combats.\n\nInstall §YAnti-Air Destroyer Role§! on §YLight Hull§! to unlock §YSurface-to-Air Missiles§!."
 
 early_cruiser_armor: "Great War Cruiser Armor"
 early_cruiser_armor_desc: "The cruiser armor developed during the Great War. Protected cruisers replaced unprotected cruisers in the 1890s, and also pointed out the future development direction of cruisers.\n\nMounting this module on §YCruisers§! improves their ability to §Ywithstand enemy damage§!, but also §Rreduces§! their §Yspeed§!."
 basic_cruiser_armor: "Interwar Cruiser Armor"
 basic_cruiser_armor_desc: "The restriction on displacement of cruisers made by Washington Naval Treaty in the 1920s promoted the naval designers to adopt ideas, such as inclined armor, to save the tonnage. Newly designed cruisers generally had moderate armor, which could resist shells from old rapid-fire guns.\n\nMounting this module on §YCruisers§! improves their ability to §Ywithstand enemy damage§!, but also §Rreduces§! their §Yspeed§!."
 improved_cruiser_armor: "Improved Cruiser Armor"
 improved_cruiser_armor_desc: "With looming tensions across the world, the Washington System was crumbling when Japan and Italy refused to sign the Second London Naval Treaty, and both started to build cruisers exceeding the restriction. The cruiser armor has emerged thicker and harder as the times require.\n\nMounting this module on §YCruisers§! improves their ability to §Ywithstand enemy damage§!, but also §Rreduces§! their §Yspeed§!."
 advanced_cruiser_armor: "Advanced Cruiser Armor"
 advanced_cruiser_armor_desc: "Experience gained in the war has further promoted the development of cruiser. Besides heavy armor, the new cruisers also adopted an armor layout design similar to that of the battleship. While maintaining a high speed, it allocated more tonnage to the defense of key parts.\n\nMounting this module on §YCruisers§! improves their ability to §Ywithstand enemy damage§!, but also §Rreduces§! their §Yspeed§!."
 searchlight: "Searchlight"
 searchlight_desc: "A set of high-power lights, which are generally installed on the side of cruisers or battleships to search for enemy ships during night battles, and can also assist ship navigation in foggy weather. Although it can obtain a better field of vision, it may expose one's own position if used rashly."
 treaty_cruiser_trend: "Treaty Cruiser"
 treaty_cruiser_trend_desc: "With the concern that a subsequent race in building larger, more powerful cruisers might subvert the usefulness of the prohibition on capital ship construction, representatives of the United States, Great Britain, Japan, France and Italy set limits on the tonnage and firepower of cruisers to 10,000 tons in standard displacement and 8 inches for maximum main gun caliber."
 colony_cruiser: "Colonial Cruiser"
 colony_cruiser_desc: "To guard the vast colonies, the empires' cruiser design has always taken range and cost into consideration. Colonial cruiser is not a specific class of cruiser, but it has features including low cost, speed advantage and good seaworthiness. Deployed far from the heart of the empires, it is more than sufficient to maintain a relatively strong naval presence even at the edge of world.\n\nInstall §YColonial Cruiser Role§! on §YCruiser Hull§! to reduce §YCost§!."
 cruiser_gun_upgrade: "Cruiser Semi-Autoloader"
 cruiser_gun_upgrade_desc: "With improving performance of destroyers in the 1930s, the old rapid-fire guns on cruisers could no longer meet the needs of actual combat. To ensure combat efficiency against destroyers, cruisers were equipped with mechanical loading machines, which increases the rate of fire while saving the manpower. Although this loading machine still requires manual assistance, it can achieve a loading efficiency exceeding that of non-autoloading guns."
 cruiser_aa_upgrade: "Anti-Air Cruiser Refit"
 cruiser_aa_upgrade_desc: "Although many conservatives in the navy are still unwilling to admit it, the performance of carrier-based aircraft has made great progress in the 1920s and 1930s. From the many naval-aeronautic exercises held, some people saw the dominance of aircraft carriers in the future naval combat. To reinforce the fleet's weak anti-air capability, the naval powers started to strengthen anti-air guns on their cruisers in the 1930s.\n\nInstall §YAnti-Air Cruiser Role§! on §YCruiser Hull§! to strengthen §YAnti-Air Attack§!."
 destroyer_cruiser_trend: "Super Destroyer"
 destroyer_cruiser_trend_desc: "With the advent of large destroyers, a new type of ship putting cruiser-level firepower on a light hull appeared, further reinforcing the light cruiser forces. Its definition was different across the world for its intermediate armaments. It can be the flotilla leader in a squadron, and a destroyer killer when acting alone. Even if it encounters a cruiser, it can rely on its speed advantage to escape.\n\nInstall §YSuper Destroyer Role§! on §YLight Hull§! to unlock §YLight Medium Battery§!."
 cruiser_radar_sentry: "Radar Picket Refit"
 cruiser_radar_sentry_desc: "Radar has completely changed the mode of spotting enemies in naval warfare, even the most trained observers cannot match its detection range. As the vanguard of the fleet, cruisers became the first naval ships to install radars. Deployed close to the forward position, cruisers can detect farther distance with radars, allowing the fleet to spot the enemy earlier than before.\n\nInstall §YRadar Picket Role§! on §YCruiser Hull§! to strengthen §YSurface Detection§!."
 fighter_directional_system: "Fighter Directional System"
 fighter_directional_system_desc: "The predecessor of the ship-controlled interception system was the ground-controlled joint interception tactics developed in the war. By connecting multiple radar stations to the joint control center, the headquarters can issue more accurate information on position and speed of enemy aircrafts to fighters. Upon the advance of ship radars, this system was also used in naval operations. The intel gathered by each ship would be summarized to lead the carrier fighters intercepting enemy aircrafts more efficiently."
 cruiser_missile_upgrade: "Missile Cruiser Refit"
 cruiser_missile_upgrade_desc: "It has rendered naval guns weak and useless in the face of anti-ship missiles. Missiles are not only powerful but also more accurate. Although battleships can use their ample space to install launchers, it is not that easy on cruisers. For this reason, it is necessary to pay a little price.\n\nInstall §YMissile Cruiser Role§! on §YCruiser Hull§! to unlock §YAnti-Ship Missile§!."
 helipad: "Helipad"
 helipad_desc: "The idea of helicopter was invented way before the 20th century, but hundreds of them were first built and deployed in the war during the Second World War. At first, helicopters were used in small numbers for observation, transport, and medical evacuation. As vertical flight would save more space on a narrow deck of ship, the navy also saw this breakthrough as a perfect replenishment for seaplanes. But before turboshaft was developed, helicopters only played a very limited role in naval opearations."
 
 basic_heavy_armor: "Interwar Heavy Armor"
 basic_heavy_armor_desc: "After the end of Great War, capital ships began to adopt thicker armor to cope with the rapid advancement of naval guns. The armor belts of front-line battleships could usually reach a thickness of more than 300 mm, which was able to basically defend against the shooting of main guns built during the war.\n\nMounting this module on §YHeavy Ships§! improves their ability to §Ywithstand enemy damage§!. §YBattleships§! and §YBattlecruisers§! are defined by their different §YArmors§!."
 improved_heavy_armor: "Improved Heavy Armor"
 improved_heavy_armor_desc: "In the 1930s, inclined armor was applied on the newly designed capital ships. Despite a slightly inferior thickness, it could achieve a similar level of protection as thicker vertical armor.\n\nMounting this module on §YHeavy Ships§! improves their ability to §Ywithstand enemy damage§!. §YBattleships§! and §YBattlecruisers§! are defined by their different §YArmors§!."
 advanced_heavy_armor: "Advanced Heavy Armor"
 advanced_heavy_armor_desc: "The new heavy armor designed in the Second World War applied the latest steel-manufacturing technology. The new steel is stronger and more resilient, and will not crack under the oblique shooting of some armor-piercing shells.\n\nMounting this module on §YHeavy Ships§! improves their ability to §Ywithstand enemy damage§!. §YBattleships§! and §YBattlecruisers§! are defined by their different §YArmors§!."
 
 incremental_armor_scheme: "Post-Jutland Armor Scheme"
 incremental_armor_scheme_desc: "The Battle of Jutland proved the flaws in the armor layout design of capital ships. Lacking awareness of the long combat distance, the armor of previous battleships generally lacked the ability to resist 15-inch naval guns. The new armor scheme developed after that was also known as the post-Jutland scheme, which was just a temporary design, mainly strengthening the deck armor, and soon became obsolete after the war.\n\nInstall §YArmor Scheme§! on §YHeavy Hull§! to strengthen §YArmor§! or §YHP§!."
 mixed_armor_scheme: "Mixed Armor Scheme"
 mixed_armor_scheme_desc: "The mixed scheme is a transitional armor scheme appeared after the war, which mainly integrated lessons learned from Jutland and the idea of all-or-nothing defense. Compared with the incremental scheme invented 20 years ago, it has a better armor ratio in some areas that are highly vulnerable.\n\nInstall §YArmor Scheme§! on §YHeavy Hull§! to strengthen §YArmor§! or §YHP§!."
 all_or_nothing_armor_scheme: "All-or-Nothing Armor Scheme"
 all_or_nothing_armor_scheme_desc: "The all-or-nothing scheme was first used on the Nevada-class battleships, and has been applied on all US battleships after that. Under the premise of the same tonnage, the all-or-nothing idea greatly saves the armor of non-essential areas, and uses armor boxes to protect the fragile magazine and main engine. Ships with this type of armor scheme usually have better survivability.\n\nInstall §YArmor Scheme§! on §YHeavy Hull§! to strengthen §YArmor§! or §YHP§!."
 all_or_nothing_armor_box_armor_scheme: "Enhanced All-or-Nothing Armor Scheme"
 all_or_nothing_armor_box_armor_scheme_desc: "During the Second World War, the research on battleship armor went to a higher level that all-or-nothing scheme was widely used, which promoted a series of shells with stronger armor penetration. As a result, secondary armor boxes were installed on new battleships to enhance the overall strength of the ship while protecting secondary areas such as crew quarters.\n\nInstall §YArmor Scheme§! on §YHeavy Hull§! to strengthen §YArmor§! or §YHP§!."
 harvey_steel: "Harvey Steel"
 harvey_steel_desc: "Harvey armor was a type of steel armor developed by American engineer Hayward Harvey in the early 1890s. It was once popular and saw several main producers of the armor plate including Vickers, Krupp and Bethlehem."
 krupp_steel: "Krupp Armor"
 krupp_steel_desc: "Krupp armor was invented by Germany's Krupp Arm Works in 1893 and replaced Harvey armor as a primary method of protecting naval ships. The manufacturing of Krupp armor was very similar to Harveyized armor, but the Krupp process, instead of generally using nickel-steel, added as much as 1% chromium to the alloy for additional hardness. Early ballistic tests showed that 260mm of Krupp armor offered the same protection as 300mm of Harvey armor."
 krupp_cemented_steel: "Krupp Cemented Armor"
 krupp_cemented_steel_desc: "The manufacturing process of Krupp cemented armor (KCA) remained largely the same as original Krupp steel armor, with slight changes in the alloy composition. The KCA retained the hardened surface via the application of carbonized gases but also had a much greater fibrous elasticity on the rear of the plate, which greatly reduced the incidence of spalling and cracking under incoming fire."
 ducol_steel: "Ducol Steel"
 ducol_steel_desc: "Ducol or D-steel is the name of a number of high-strength low-alloy steels of varying composition, first developed from the early 1920s by the Scottish firm of David Colville & Sons. Applications have included ship hull construction, light armoring and pressure vessels such as locomotive steam boilers."
 homogeneous_krupp_steel: "Homogeneous Krupp Armor"
 homogeneous_krupp_steel_desc: "Developments in face-hardened armor in the late 19th and early 20th centuries revealed that such armor was less effective against glancing oblique impacts. The hardened face layer's brittleness was counterproductive against such impacts. The new invention of homogeneous steel combined ductility and tensile strength, and was typically used for deck and waterline protection."
 
 basic_torpedo_defense: "Early Torpedo Defense System"
 basic_torpedo_defense_desc: "A torpedo fired by a torpedo boat that costs less than one percent of a battleship can cause the same damage as a naval heavy gun hits, or even more deadly. The battleships during the Great War installed torpedo defense systems one after another to resist such threat. By separating more watertight compartments inside the hull, the effect of taking in water was balanced. Similar efforts included torpedo bulges, which were filled with liquid to maximize absorption from underwater blasts.\n\nInstall §YTorpedo Defense System§! on §YHeavy Hull§! to reduce §RTorpedo Damage§!."
 improved_torpedo_defense: "Improved Torpedo Defense System"
 improved_torpedo_defense_desc: "The power of the emerging new torpedoes has far exceeded those of the past. To make up for the shortcomings of the Great War torpedo defense system, armor was put behind areas that are vulnerable to torpedo attacks, and together with the torpedo bulkheads, they can resist some impacts from torpedoes.\n\nInstall §YTorpedo Defense System§! on §YHeavy Hull§! to reduce §RTorpedo Damage§!."
 advanced_torpedo_defense: "Advanced Torpedo Defense System"
 advanced_torpedo_defense_desc: "The latest torpedo defense system tried to protect the hull from torpedoes by separating more watertight compartments, which can ensure that the basic buoyancy of the ship is not affected, and the improvement of the armor manufacturing process has also strengthened the torpedo belt.\n\nInstall §YTorpedo Defense System§! on §YHeavy Hull§! to reduce §RTorpedo Damage§!."
 enhanced_horizontal_defense: "Deck Armoring"
 enhanced_horizontal_defense_desc: "The parabolic trajectory from long distance is one of the most common ways to hit a ship in naval battles. The Battle of Jutland has already rendered deck armor of battleships weak, and thereby pushed the naval powers to enhance their horizontal protection."
 heavy_ship_refit_reduction: "Obsolete Ship Refit"
 heavy_ship_refit_reduction_desc: "The Naval Holiday has largely paused every country's shipbuilding efforts. To improve the fleet under strict observation, modernizing old ships had become an efficient and economical approach."
 dry_dock_expansion: "Dry Dock Expansion"
 dry_dock_expansion_desc: "Naval powers began to build larger battleships immediately after the Great War, which required bigger dockyards than those used for dreadnoughts. To accommodate the huge hulls, the shipbuilding enterprises expanded their dry docks built in the early 20th century.\nAlthough these super battleships were never launched, the new docks remained. They not only could be used to build larger capital ships, but the heavy cranes and port facilities have also greatly improved the efficiency of repair and maintenance."
 improved_conning_tower: "Improved Conning Tower"
 improved_conning_tower_desc: "The conning tower is the core of a battleship. In past wars, it has always assumed the duties of command, reconnaissance and fire control. The development of naval guns has also led to the evolution of the conning tower. Once without enough protection, the integrated and enclosed bridge could provide better protection for the commanding personnel, and at the same time create plenty of room for the communication department."
 fuel_oil_boiler: "Oil Boiler"
 fuel_oil_boiler_desc: "Fuel oil is a heavy oil remaining after the process of extracting gasoline or diesel from crude oil, which is very viscous and difficult to volatilize. Due to its high calorific value, fuel oil can be burned more fully, providing stronger power for ships, while producing less smoke than coal-powered boilers."
 ship_living_standard: "Ship Living Standard Improvement"
 ship_living_standard_desc: "The living environment aboard was very harsh, but this situation is gradually changing. More countries began to use iron beds and air-conditioning systems on warships to ensure the fighting will and physical condition of sailors in peacetime, so that they can devote themselves to the battle in a fuller state.\nMoreover, from tonkatsu (fried pork chop) and curry rice in Japan to macaroni and ice cream in US, food on ships got even better, though the best were reserved for officers. \n\n§CLet the army envy us!§!"
 rudder_upgrade: "Rudder Upgrade"
 rudder_upgrade_desc: "By using the improved rudder gear, the ship can turn flexibly. The smaller turning radius is beneficial for the fleet to adjust its formation or retreat as soon as possible."
 battleship_aa_upgrade: "Battleship Anti-Air Upgrade"
 battleship_aa_upgrade_desc: "The value of aircraft carriers in the war has pushed the naval powers to shift their attention to the carrier battle group, and the status of battleships seems to have deteriorated greatly. However, the carrier is still very vulnerable without the protection from battleships. Their sizes provide a platform for the fleet's air defense. These battleships equipped with a large number of anti-air guns began to appear alongside carriers as escorts."
 gas_turbine: "Gas Turbine"
 gas_turbine_desc: "The gas turbine uses continuous flowing gas as the working medium to drive the impeller to rotate at high speed, and converts the energy of the fuel into an internal combustion machine. It is much faster than the traditional steam turbine, but limited by technologies such as heat-resistant materials, the application scenarios of gas turbines are relatively few."
 fuel_tank_upgrade: "Large Fuel Tank"
 fuel_tank_upgrade_desc: "The standard for building a global navy is that the country's fleet can be deployed far away from its sphere of influence under any circumstances, and effectively implement deterrence locally. Having larger fuel tanks on our ships can help achieve this goal."
 radar_jammer: "Radar Jammer"
 radar_jammer_desc: "The invention of radar greatly facilitated the ability to locate the enemy, which is crucial in naval warfare. A series of interference technologies were developed to counter it. Interference was initially achieved by throwing metal chaff and other passive methods. Now the clutter jammer can release a large amount of interference in the enemy's radar operating frequency, making it more difficult to locate us."
 combat_information_center: "Combat Information Center"
 combat_information_center_desc: "The combat information center, or CIC, is the heart of a warship. At the end of the war, the most advanced naval ships had all types of electronic devices installed including search radar, anti-air radar and fire control system. The past conning tower no longer met the requirement. CIC integrated every control unit of the electronic systems aboard, with aid from computers, it could provide the captain or fleet commander with faster and more detailed information."
 
 prototype_airplane_launcher: "Prototype Airplane Launcher"
 prototype_airplane_launcher_desc: "The ship airplane launcher, inveneted by Britain, uses hydraulic pressure to eject light seaplanes from ships with limited space, and then recovers them with a crane at the tail. Some countries have experimented with the application of seaplanes in the Great War. However, with the increasing size of aircrafts, the conventional catapult could no longer guarantee the effective combat load of the plane, which eventually gave birth to the aircraft carrier in the future."
 early_carrier_study: "Carrier Study"
 early_carrier_study_desc: "Equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft, the carrier fulfilled the need to launch air raids from the sea. Before the advent of the first carrier, there were various studies made by different leading countries in aero industry, which laid a solid foundation for those latecomers."
 landing_aid_system: "Landing Aid System"
 landing_aid_system_desc: "Landing of carrier-based aircraft is the most dangerous subject in carrier operations. Despite bearing a title of 'system', the landing aid operations were mostly carried out by man. Navy would have landing signal officers (LSO) on every carrier to guide landing operations. They were sometimes served by experienced pilots, and used a set of semaphores with colored paddles to help pilots adjust the landing attitude."
 arresting_gear: "Arresting Gear"
 arresting_gear_desc: "The landing arrestment system is an auxiliary equipment on the carrier, which achieves safe landing of the aircraft on carrier deck. As the most important part of this device, the arresting gear catches the tailhook of the plane with a high-strength rope. If it fails to do its job, the barricade will become the last measure."
 aviation_dawn: "Aviation Dawn"
 aviation_dawn_desc: "With the development of naval aviation, its status in the fleet has also been greatly improved. The Japanese Navy, the Royal Navy and the US Navy have organized a large number of exercises in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and came up with a series of naval and air tactics. Due to the high technical threshold, any country's navy must go through practice if it wants to build a powerful naval aviation force.\n\nYet it is not easy for any country possessing a large battleship force to change the course, resistance from vested interests is expected.\n\n§RThe age of airplanes is here, guns and armors were the past......§!"
 night_air_strike: "Night-time Air Strike"
 night_air_strike_desc: "Navigating at night is an extremely dangerous task, but it can offer the element of surprise. Through extensive take-off and landing trainings on carriers at night, the pilots and ground crews have gradually acquired the ability to launch effective air strikes during night time with good lighting conditions."
 dive_bomber_study: "Dive Bomber Study"
 dive_bomber_study_desc: "Unlike torpedo bombers, dive bombers attack from high altitude, making them harder for fighters or anti-air guns to intercept. Additionally, diving directly at its targets provides greater accuracy for the bomb, and simplifies the bomb's trajectory to allow the pilot to keep visual contact throughout the bomb run. The agility also ensures that they can attack and escape at high speed, increasing survivability while rendering evasive manouvers by the target ships ineffective."
 carrier_mass_production: "Carrier Mass Production"
 carrier_mass_production_desc: "After years of development, carrier was no longer a crude ship with wooden decks installed. On the contrary, more and more new technologies were applied to aircraft carriers, and it even had a tendency to surpass battleships. The new construction mode could advance the launching of carriers."
 vnr_ship_hull_escort_carrier: "Escort Carrier"
 vnr_ship_hull_escort_carrier_desc: "Submarines has seriously threatened the merchant fleet during the war. Although aircrafts had higher anti-submarine efficiency, they could not provide cover for convoy deep in the ocean. The value of regular carriers limited their use in frontal battlefields. Escort carriers with small hangars were built at this time. They were very cheap for some civilian components used."
 folding_wing: "Folding Wing"
 folding_wing_desc: "The naval battle of the Second World War was a three-dimensional form of combat, and the role played by plane was crucial. To achieve greater capacity on carriers, aviation designers applied folding wings on airplanes to save deck and hangar space, but this required high craftsmanship on the wings."
 carrier_damage_control: "Integrated Damage Control"
 carrier_damage_control_desc: "Damage control is the emergency control of situations that may cause the sinking of a watercraft. Navies of western countries have long been aware of the importance of a professional firefighting and repair team. The lessons learned from war only made it more pronounced, especially for carriers, the primary naval assets.\nThe damage control department consists of not only the men but also devices including fire extinguishers and fire-retardant fuel tanks."
 air_fuel_storage: "Air Fuel Storage"
 air_fuel_storage_desc: "More extensive carrier opearations during the Second World War urged carriers to have larger fuel tanks, while the quantity of air fuel aboard is also crucial to the range and loads of carrier-based aircrafts.\nMore air fuel carried usually means the carrier can support more air groups efficiently.\n\nAir fuel storage can help §Ycarrier-based aircrafts§! improve §Yrange§! and §Yagility§!."
 full_armored_carrier: "Enclosed Armored Carrier"
 full_armored_carrier_desc: "The United Kingdom was the first to adopt armored flight decks on carriers before the war, which could prevent dive bombing from damaging the deck in combat. This idea was quickly adopted by other naval powers in the war, and their new carriers were all reinforced with armored decks. At the end of the war, the most advanced carriers started to be characterized by fully enclosed hangars and heavily armored decks."
 carrier_steam_catapult: "CATOBAR"
 carrier_steam_catapult_desc: "Even the state-of-the-art propeller fighters were quickly made obsolete by jet planes at the end of the war. The navy decided to put some on carriers, but their weight has been greatly increased with usage of advanced materials and were unable to take off from decks with limited length. Some naval designers proposed connecting the ship's steam turbine to the catapult, so that the jet fighters can be launched more efficiently. Such system is called CATOBAR, or \"Catapult Assisted Take-Off Barrier Arrested Recovery\""
 carrier_angled_deck: "Angled Flight Deck"
 carrier_angled_deck_desc: "The angled deck appeared in the late 1940s and was usually located on the left side of the flight deck, forming an angle of 6 to 13 degrees with the centerline. The entire flight deck was divided into two areas, allowing the carrier to perform take-off and landing operations at the same time, which greatly improves the sortie efficiency."
 vnr_ship_hull_super_carrier: "Super Carrier Hull"
 vnr_ship_hull_super_carrier_desc: "As the war drawed to a close, the dominant position of carriers in the fleet has been established and great attention was paid to their capacity. Meanwhile, the enclosed hangar and armored flight deck have matured, and the new carrier has also adopted all technological innovations such as angled decks and steam catapults. This type of ship with better sortie efficiency and capacity was called super carrier."
 
 acoustic_signature: "Acoustic Signature Study"
 acoustic_signature_desc: "Acoustic signature is used to describe a combination of acoustic emissions of sound emitters, such as those of ships and submarines. Through large-scale spying and surveillance operations during peacetime, the acoustic signatures of warships were collected and included in recognition manuals, which were distributed to the sonar operators to identify enemy ships during the war."
 teardrop_hull: "Teardrop Hull"
 teardrop_hull_desc: "A teardrop hull is a submarine hull design which emphasizes submerged performance over surfaced performance. It was somewhat commonly used in the early stages of submarine development, but was gradually abandoned in the early 20th century in favour of designs optimized for high performance on the surface as a result of changes in operational doctrine. Despite that, the technology still had a profound impact in future designs of submarines."
 diesel_electric_transmission: "Diesel-Electric Transmission"
 diesel_electric_transmission_desc: "Before the invention of ship diesel engine, attempts to drive submarines with kerosene and gasoline all failed due to their high volatility. To extend submarine's submersion time, the diesel-electric power system was introduced, it was composed of diesel engine, electric engine, generator and storage battery. The diesel engine was used on the surface, powering the generator, while the electric engine was for underwater scenario with little oxygen from air."
 basic_periscope: "Basic Periscope"
 basic_periscope_desc: "Periscopes have been used as early as 1906 on Germany's first submarine, which can observe the situation on the water without surfacing."
 improved_periscope: "Improved Periscope"
 improved_periscope_desc: "Improved prisms and lenses were used in the manufacturing of new periscopes, this would achieve better imaging effects and facilitate the captain to observe enemy targets."
 advanced_periscope: "Advanced Periscope"
 advanced_periscope_desc: "New technology focused on solving the vibration problem of periscopes when the submarine is sailing. With the additional mast bracket, even if the submarine sails at a speed of 6-8 knots, its periscope will not be affected by the waves. Another improvement was the increased watertightness, an upgrade that protects the optics from the impact of a depth charge blast."
