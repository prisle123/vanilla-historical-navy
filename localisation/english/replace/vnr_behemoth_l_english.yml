 navy_rework.1.t: "Sea Monster?"
 navy_rework.1.d: "Recently, our Fishing Department has received reports from many fishermen of a giant sea creature near the coastal fishing grounds, which moves fast and is larger than any ship they have ever seen. They were not taken seriously at first, until several fishing boats were head-on by sea monster while fishing at night, and the snowflakes of reports forced the government to react.\n\nA team composed of biologists and naval officers was quickly assembled, and they called nearby whaling ships and some naval patrol ships to search for traces of the sea monster at night. In the first few days, nothing was found, and the investigation team gradually lost patience. Some people blamed this on the ignorance of the fishermen. But a week later, the investigative team finally made progress.\n\nOn a night of full moon, a low humming sound began to appear underwater, which aroused everyone's vigilance. When all the ships aimed their searchlights at the restless sea, everyone saw the fast moving underwater shadow. \"There's no way a creature can swim that fast!\", a marine biologist screamed, but was soon silenced by people's fear of seeing the black shadow getting bigger and bigger. A giant black beast rushed out of the water and overturned several small boats nearby. People looked from the rain and fog caused by the sea monster's ascent, only to find that it was actually a huge submarine, just like the Nautilus portrayed by Jules Verne.\n\nLights came on on the submarine's deck, and the survey team could see some of the crew stepping out of it. A bold patrol ship sailed directly towards the black fish. While everyone was holding their breaths, the crew of the submarine did not show any hostility, but signaled the investigation team to board the ship. On the deck, they saw the captain, Matias Torres, who claimed to be at war with a country called the Osean Federation, but lost all ties with the motherland after a dive. Although no one could understand what he said, they came to an astonishing conclusion that this submarine seemed to use nuclear fission as a source of power, and it has a flight deck and a gun powered by electromagnetic force. Even the strongest warship in the world will be nothing compared to it.\n\nTo supplement the shortage of food on the submarine, Captain Torres reached an agreement with our government to assist our navy until he finds a way to return to his world."

Patrol team 00732 has been dispatched for rescue.\n\n14:10:03 Area [40°83′30″N 68°03′46″W]: Coast Guard Patrol Team 00640 encountered an unidentified armed wooden sailing vessel while on patrol. The vessel's armament appears to be a metal-made suspected medium-sized naval gun at the stern, and it flies the American flag at the bow. The sailing vessel appeared on the port side of the patrol boat, approximately 1.7 nautical miles away, heading northeast towards the New England coast at a speed exceeding 45 knots. All units have been notified to be on alert and intercept if necessary.\n\n14:10:03 Area [41°19′32″N 68°03′46″W]: The vessel is identified as a sailing warship from the last century, not listed in the records.

Urgent Message !!!§!\n\nTo Comrade Stalin and the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union:\n\nAt around 3 am today, a wind-sail warship flying the American flag launched a sudden attack on the Leningrad Fleet Base, causing varying degrees of damage to the harbor and the Baltic Fleet. The brave and fearless sailors of the Red Navy effectively counterattacked the invaders with coastal artillery and the guns aboard the Kirov cruiser, leading to the sinking of the wind-sail warship. Strangely, among the wreckage salvaged, we did not find any human remains but rather a pile of peculiar steel and items resembling engines. Our scientists believe that these may be a new type of propulsion and weapon systems, and further research is underway.\n\nIn terms of losses, the warship nearly devastated berths 3, 5, and 6 in Leningrad harbor, but the Baltic Fleet has suffered slight damage. Although the United States has not shown any response or intention to attack before or after this incident, our agents have not obtained any relevant information suggesting premeditated planning by the United States. Some investigators believe that this may not be of Earthly origin, but we prefer to trust what we see. The capitalist world has shown hostility towards us for a long time, and we can take this as another beginning of a siege against the Soviet Union.\n\nThe major military districts have already entered Level 1 combat readiness according to the plan.

 constitution_com_2: "§RReport from the People's National Defense Committee§!\n\nComrade Chairman,\n\nIn the early hours of yesterday, a wind-powered warship flying the flag of the United States approached in our territorial waters. Upon boarding and inspection by our scientific and naval comrades, they found a steel monster wearing a captain's hat, seemingly the captain of that ship. Just as our researcher comrades finally found a way to establish contact with the monster, it launched a sudden attack against our investigation team. Unfortunately, the entire team was lost without any survivors. The monster then piloted the warship to attack our ships docked at the port, causing substantial damage. It took considerable effort from our coastal defense forces to finally sink the warship. Regrettably, most of its weapons were irreparably damaged, and we only salvaged some remnants of the artillery components, which have been sent for research.\n\nRegarding where this ship came from, one of our researchers believes it couldn't be the United States in our world, as the steel monster made strange statements like \"nuclear war\". These technologies are clearly beyond the current capabilities of imperialist America. However, some members of the Defense Committee are asking to take this opportunity to severely punish the imperialists."
 constitution_generic_1: "Although many people are still using sailing ships today, it is still very rare to see the majestic appearance of sailing warships. Recently, among the sailors in some ports, a news spread quickly that a cargo ship found a sailing warship flying the American flag not far from our territorial waters. It is said that this ship has three masts, which is very similar to the past frigates, some people believe it is the USS Constitution. However, this obviously raises more doubts. Just a few years ago, she had just completed a global tour under the tow of a minesweeper, and is now exhibited in Boston as a museum.\n\nAs conspiracy spread like wildfire, and the Boston city government confirmed that USS Constitution was mooring in Boston Harbor, some adventurers formed a team to find this aimlessly cruising sailboat on the high seas.\n\nThe team found the warship in a deserted bay with little effort. Surprisingly, this ship is the USS Constitution. They contacted the local government after leaving some people to guard this ship from a distance. The garrison then sent hundreds of troops to surround the ship.\n\nConfirming that there were no signs of life on the deck, an officer boarded USS Constitution with a dozen soldiers. It wasn't until they approached that people discovered that it was installed with several huge propellers, but they were different from all technologies known to mankind. They found several strangely shaped steel objects, one of which was a huge humanoid thing with a naval officer's hat on its top. A soldier waked it by inadvertently touching it. \"This is the commander of USS Constitution and US Military, Capitan Ironsides. Why do you board my ship?\", the head of the machine gave off a dim red light, and after our officer tremblingly reported his name and purpose, Captain Ironsides seemed to let his guard down. \"I apologize for invading your territorial waters, there must be something wrong with our navigation system, but my country is now at war with Communist China and I must go to the front line immediately.\", he said politely.\n\nIn the later conversation, the team learned about the world that Captain Ironsides came from, where breakthroughs in robotics and nuclear technology were made, and there was a great war broke out between the United States and China, and the subsequent nuclear war almost destroyed the entire world. Ironsides and his ship are the only remaining US troops. After we promised to help them as best we could, Captain Ironsides offered to take orders from us for the time being."

The expedition team was commanded by an army major and accompanied by a group of experts and scientists.\n\nThe small island has been deserted for years, and now there are no residents. Some navy ships have blocked the waters around the island. The expedition landed on the island the next morning and began its journey to the depths. In a cloud of dust, the expedition finally reached the center of the island around noon, and they were about to be shocked by what they saw. It was a huge mechanical object with a length of more than one kilometer, almost the size of a small town. It was absolutely impossible to build such a large object with human technology.\n\nThrough some narrow cracks and passages, the team successfully entered the interior of the object, and some people believed that it might be a huge spaceship built by an alien race. Further investigation confirmed people's conjectures, they found the remains of some tall unknown humanoid creatures, which almost made everyone conclude that it was an alien spacecraft.\n\nUnder the influence of such a major discovery, the government sent a large number of troops to surround the entire island, and countless researchers came to the island to study the spacecraft. However, these technologies are too advanced for humans to understand. After cleaning the interior, the engineering corps repaired the hull as much as it could. Since the hull suffered little damage, the spacecraft was still usable. Our scientists actually managed to activate it by accident, and the automated maintenance machine quickly repaired all malfunctioning equipments. Even its combat system is fully automated.\n\nAlthough we don't know how to use this spacecraft at all now, the government and military are so excited that they named this spacecraft Macross."

 navy_rework.4.d: "Hiraga Yuzuru couldn't sleep well ever after the inquiry. As the most renowned and experienced naval architect of the Empire of Japan, Hiraga now suffered serious insomnia due to the Tomozuru Incident happened a few years back, which was a huge setback to his reputation.\n\nIn 1934, the torpedo boat Tomozuru, designed by Hiraga, capsized in the midst of a storm, causing a loss of more than a hundred lives. Whenever he closes his eyes, he can see the spirits of crewmen lingering in front of him and asking why they have to die. The remorse has tortured Hiraga for years and the recent Fourth Fleet Incident only made it worse.\n\nWhile participating in field manoeuvres, the Fourth Fleet became caught in extremely foul weather. The weather continued to deteriorate and by 26 September had reached typhoon status. Two of the newer, large Special Type destroyers, the Hatsuyuki and the Yūgiri, had their bows torn away by the heavy seas. A number of recently built heavy cruisers also suffered significant structural damage. The Myōkō, the Mogami and the submarine tender Taigei developed serious cracks in their hulls, and the light aircraft-carriers Hōshō and Ryūjō suffered damage to their flight decks and superstructure, with the Ryūjō also having her hangar section flooded. The minelayer Itsukushima suffered damage that required several months for extensive repairs, necessitating a near complete rebuild. Nearly all the fleet's destroyers suffered damage to their superstructures, and fifty-four crewmen were lost, swept overboard or killed outright. Immediately after that, the Admiralty held a hearing on the event, blaming Hiraga for his flawed designs that were top-heavy and tended towards instability.\n\nHiraga had some rice wine tonight. It has become his habit to have alcohol before sleep to deal with all the stress. Surprisingly, he fell asleep quickly this time. Soon, he started dreaming.\n\nIn his dream, he felt floating in a dark void, without any gravity. A beam of light came across the empty space, illuminating everything. It took him a while realizing he was actually in the outer space, with the enormous planet Earth occupying all of his sight. Being well educated, he knew sound can't travel in vaccum, but a muffled roar somehow reached his ear. Hiraga turned his head slowly just to find another huge object blocking his vision. \"My Lord...\", he spoke in a mumble. He tried to calm down and comprehend what that was. At the top of it, he saw a Chrysanthemum Seal, a symbol of the Emperor. The golden emblem shone dazzlingly, bringing his train of thoughts back to earlier days as naval designer and making him finally understand that was a gigantic battleship. Even though the appearance of the ship didn't resemble any imperial warship in service, Hiraga's eyes were caught by her curves that he spent hours gazing at the battleship. \"Remarkable, she will be the most beautiful ship ever...\".\n\nSuddenly, a ring drew Hiraga back to reality. He took a look at the clock, it was two in the morning, and the city was still silent. He felt a bit mad and took up the telephone, but before he could ask anything, there was a voice from the other side, \"Vice Admiral, the Admiralty requests your presence immediately\". \"Why is it so urgent?\", Hiraga asked, but the man did not answer directly, \"This is top secret right now, but in my terms of reference, I call to inform you to lead a design team. Car is waiting.\"\n\nHiraga turned to look up at the dark night sky of Tokyo and mumbled, \"Yamato\"."
