 navy_rework_welcome_splash_tab_1_content: "The navy rework has adopted a semi-historical designer and balanced all the stats of modules.\n\n§CDesigner-§!\n£white_dot When designing a §Ydestroyer§!, §Ycruiser, §! or §Ybattleship§!, the §Ymain gun§! is the only thing reflecting reality here. Since their firepower or AP are balanced, §Rplease make sure that their numbers are close to reality§!. Modules including §Ysecondaries§! and §Ytorpedo§! are the same as vanilla.\n£white_dot Some restricted modules are unlocked in the mod, you can build battleships with super heavy guns, heavy cruisers with light guns and unprotected cruisers.\n£white_dot Ship roles are essential on destroyers and cruisers, they can offer different bonuses and unlock special modules.\n£white_dot §YMissiles§! can be installed on advanced heavy hull and advanced cruiser hull, but the latter requires CG role to unlock missiles.\n£white_dot Torpedoes can do great damage to heavy ships, while armor can only defend a little, you have to install §Ytorpedo defense system§! to avoid that.\n£white_dot The AP of main guns is rebalanced based on certain rules. The basic AP is 1.1 times greater than armor of the same year, meaning that ordinary steel and mixed scheme can reject penetration, while the succeeded guns can pierce it even with all-or-nothing scheme.\n£white_dot The §Ysuper heavy guns§! are grouped with §Yheavy guns§! based on their mounting, but they are still restricted to be installed on certain ship hulls.\n£white_dot The ship role icon in the designer can help you better manage your fleet. It only indicates the definition of this ship for the country you are playing.\n£white_dot Auxiliary ships are fragile, but they have super long range. As the max range of your fleet is decided by average range of all composed ships, it will increase the max range by having some auxiliary ships.\n\n§CTech Tree-§!\n£white_dot Although the appearance of tech tree is changed, its core is still simialr to vanilla, you don't need another hour to find out how it works.\n£white_dot Not all techs are valuable, make your choice wisely based on your strategy and geopolitical situation.\n£white_dot To unlock the sub techs, you will need the hull tech to be researched. Some sub techs also require the progress of other non-naval techs. For example, passive sonar leads to active sonar, and some fire control systems and missiles take some engineering techs as prerequisites.\n\n§CMiscellaneous-§!\n£white_dot Player and AI have a -15% bonus on navy fuel consumption.\n£white_dot The production of a single dockyard is increased to 160%, normally it takes five dockyards 1-2 years to build a battleship without any output bonus.\n£white_dot AI of major powers will unlock a series of naval techs and unique ship designs in 1940, 1943 and 1945 (if not capitulated). They will also take different naval production strategy according to its doctrine and status of war. For instance, Germany will focus on submarines, while USA will emphasize carriers."
 navy_rework_welcome_splash_tab_2_content: "The form of naval combat is changed in this mod, it features the following:\n\n£white_dot The minimum time of naval combat is increased to 20 hrs, capital ships fire at 22, other ships 30, while carriers are able to fight from the very beginning. The way you use CV naval bomber is more decisive here.\n£white_dot Ship AA guns and CV fighters are buffed with extra damage and targetting. Carrier taskforce without fighters' cover could lose more bombers.\n£white_dot Airplane launcher, carrier and sonar are more useful and stronger in anti-submarine warfare, while the base visibility of submarines is increased, making it less dominant against surface fleet with good sub detection.\n£white_dot I have intentionally made AIs design historical and realistic ships, instead of meta ones. Although these designs are way better than vanilla, your metas will still have great advantage."
 navy_rework_welcome_splash_tab_3_content: "Hi Everyone, the navy rework has been through the most difficult part of development, right now it has a historical designer, historical and realistic starting navies and designs, unique icons and a tech tree. As the framework is almost set, the rest, such as extensions, will be easier. I'd like to take this opportunity to share the past and future of this mod.\n\nI bought HOI4 in 2016 and first learned about Kaiserreich when it released ver 0.6, the Nightmare of Garibaldi. With its detailed and interesting WWII scenario, it's been one of my favorite mods since then. The naval rework released in 0.8 only took it further, I couldn't help but imagine what those dreadnoughts would look like in KRTL.\n\nOn a Friday afternoon just before 2021 Chinese New Year, I was sitting in the office and browsing Reddit, and that was when I came across an extraordinary text about Canadian and Japanese Navy written by Tragic-tragedy. I translated it and shared with the Chinese community, then I started writing blogs on the naval lore for KR, which laid a foundation for this mod.\n\nBefore the 0.22 update, the navy system has been cut for various reasons. Although I felt sad about this, it also gave me the motivation and determination to do something I have never imagined. Programming is my job, but I had to learn photoshop and English writing from scratch. Half a year passed, and we finally have the KR and KX version published. And now, I'm more than excited to announce the vanilla version.\n\nI want to express my sincere thanks to players and friends from the HOI4 community. Thank you for subscribing this mod and I wish you well.\n\nAs I'm getting busier than before on my work and family, I have no idea if it can be continued in the future, so I'm looking to build a small team to keep this mod going."
 navy_rework_welcome_splash_tab_4_content: "Hi guys, I'm looking to build a small team or have partners for this mod series. The background is that I have to handle my work, part-time master degree and my family, there is less time I can spend on modding. But I don't want to give it up right now, so if you are interested, please let me know. Programming skill is not a must, the team also need artists and advisers."
