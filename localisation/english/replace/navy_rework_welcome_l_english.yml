 navy_rework_welcome_splash_tab_2_content: "§HEvery bit you want to know about Naval Rework will be listed here.§!\n\n§CDesigner-§!\n£white_dot When designing a §Ydestroyer§!, §Ycruiser§! or §Ybattleship§!, the §Ymain gun§! is the only thing reflecting reality here. Since their firepower and AP are balanced, §Rplease make sure that their numbers are close to reality§!. Modules including §Ysecondaries§! and §Ytorpedo§! are the same as vanilla.\n£white_dot Some restricted modules are unlocked in the mod, you can build battleships with super heavy guns, heavy cruisers with light guns and unprotected cruisers.\n£white_dot Ship roles are essential on destroyers and cruisers, they can offer different bonuses and unlock special modules.\n£white_dot For cruisers, whether it's capital is not decided by its caliber. All cruisers (except panzerschiff) start as screen ship by default, and need special roles to make them capital ships.\n£white_dot §YMissiles§! can be installed on later heavy and cruiser hulls, but the latter needs missile cruiser role to unlock.\n£white_dot The screen to capital ratio to achieve max screen efficiency is 2 in this mod.\n£white_dot Torpedoes can do great damage to heavy ships, while armor can only defend a little, you have to install §Ytorpedo defense system§! to avoid that.\n£white_dot The AP of main guns is rebalanced based on certain rules. The basic AP is 1.1 times greater than armor of the same year, meaning that ordinary steel and mixed scheme can reject penetration, while the succeeded guns can pierce it even with all-or-nothing scheme.\n£white_dot The piercing and damage are calculated in the following way, the mapping between piercing-armor ratio and damage: >200% -> 100% damage, 100%~200% -> 100% damage, 85%~100% -> 70% damage, 75%~85% -> 60% damage, 60%~75% -> 45% damage, 50%~60% -> 35% damage, 30%~50% -> 20% damage, 10%~30% -> 10% damage, <10% -> 1% damage.\n£white_dot The §Ysuper heavy guns§! are grouped with §Yheavy guns§! based on their mounting, but they are still restricted to be installed on certain ship hulls.\n£white_dot The ship role icon in the designer can help you better manage your fleet. It only indicates the definition of this ship for the country you are playing.\n£white_dot Auxiliary ships are fragile, but they have super long range. As the max range of your fleet is decided by average range of all composed ships, it will increase the max range by having some auxiliary ships.\n\n§CTech Tree-§!\n£white_dot Although the appearance of tech tree is changed, its core is still simialr to vanilla, you don't need another hour to find out how it works.\n£white_dot Not all techs are valuable, make your choice wisely based on your strategy and geopolitical situation.\n£white_dot To unlock the sub techs, you will need the hull tech to be researched. Some sub techs also require the progress of other non-naval techs. For example, passive sonar leads to active sonar, and some fire control systems and missiles take engineering techs as prerequisites.\n\n§CNaval Battle-§!\n£white_dot The minimum time of naval combat is §Yincreased to 20 hrs, capital ships fire at 22, other ships 30§!, while §Gcarriers are able to launch attacks from the very beginning§!. §YThe carrier stacking limit§! is lifted to 6. The way you use CV naval bomber is more decisive here.\n£white_dot Ship AA guns and CV fighters are buffed with extra damage and targetting. Carrier taskforce without fighters' cover could lose more bombers.\n£white_dot Base positioning is reduced to 50%, but superior detection can give a positioning bonus up to 20%.\n£white_dot Penalty from deathstacking is increased to 30% of positioning for every 100% over enemy ship count, capped to 150% loss of positioning. The penalty only starts to take effect when fleet size is over 65.\n£white_dot Airplane launcher, carrier and sonar are more useful and stronger in anti-submarine warfare, while the base §Yvisibility§! of §Ysubmarines§! has been §Rincreased§!, making it less dominant against surface fleet with good sub detection.\n£white_dot AIs are intentionally designed to produce §Yhistorical and realistic ships§!, instead of meta ones. Although these designs are way better than vanilla, conventional metas will still have great advantage.\n\n§CMiscellaneous-§!\n£white_dot Player and AI have a §G-15%§! bonus on navy fuel consumption.\n£white_dot The production of a single dockyard is increased to §G160%§!, normally it takes five dockyards 1-2 years to build a battleship without any output bonus.\n£white_dot AI of major powers will unlock a series of naval techs and unique ship designs in 1940, 1943, 1945 and cold-war era (if not capitulated).\n£white_dot AI will take different naval production (including carrier plane) strategy according to its doctrine and status of war. For instance, §gGermany§! in vanilla will focus on submarines, while §BUSA§! will emphasize carriers."
 navy_rework_welcome_splash_tab_3_content: "§HAdditional information about Naval Rework will be listed here.§!\n\n§CComaptibility-§!\n£white_dot This mod is not compatible with mods editing the tech tree unless there is a §Ycompatch§!, links of existing compatches are listed in workshop page.\n£white_dot §RAll national focus/events/decisions which grants you ship designs will be broken for the sake of compatibility.§!\n\n§CRe-creation-§!\n£white_dot No official compatch will ever be made except for RT56, but the community is encouraged to do that.\n£white_dot Everyone is allowed to use any resources (code/GFX/text) from this mod, but please mark the credit and notify me first."
 navy_rework_welcome_splash_tab_4_content: "Hi Everyone, the navy rework has been through the most difficult part of development, right now it has a historical designer, historical and realistic starting navies and designs, unique icons and a tech tree. As the framework is almost set, the rest, such as extensions, will be easier. I'd like to take this opportunity to share the past and future of this mod.\n\nI bought HOI4 in 2016 and first learned about Kaiserreich when it released ver 0.6, the Nightmare of Garibaldi. With its detailed and interesting WWII scenario, it's been one of my favorite mods since then. The naval rework released in 0.8 only took it further, I couldn't help but imagine what those dreadnoughts would look like in KRTL.\n\nOn a Friday afternoon just before 2021 Chinese New Year, I was sitting in the office and browsing Reddit, and that was when I came across an extraordinary text about Canadian and Japanese Navy written by Tragic-tragedy. I translated it and shared with the Chinese community, then I started writing blogs on the naval lore for KR, which laid a foundation for this mod.\n\nBefore the 0.22 update, the navy system has been cut for various reasons. Although I felt sad about this, it also gave me the motivation and determination to do something I have never imagined. Programming is my job, but I had to learn photoshop and English writing from scratch. Half a year passed, and we finally have the KR and KX version published. And now, I'm more than excited to announce the vanilla version.\n\nI want to express my sincere thanks to players and friends from the HOI4 community. Thank you for subscribing this mod and I wish you well.\n\nI'd also like to thank my grandpa who served in PLA Navy for decades and has inspired me when I was a kid. He worked as commissar and meteorologist aboard several naval science ships in the 1970s and 1980s, with most of his years spent on Xiangyanghong 10, the largest research vessel built at that time. In 1980, Xiangyanghong 10 took part in China's first ICBM test, codename Project 580, in South Pacific, southeast to Nauru, which he was in charge of weather forecast for retrieving the missile's black box. 4 years later, he and his ship travelled to King George Island in China's first Antarctic expedition, and spent a few months there building the Great Wall Station. I can tell that he has a mixed feeling towards his life on the sea, which was glorious on serving the cause but regretful to be absent from children's growth. Despite all that, his adventures still ignited my interest in navy stuff, and planted a seed of this mod since then.\n\nAs I'm getting busier than before on my work and family, I have no idea if it can be continued in the future, so I'm looking to build a small team to keep this mod going. If you want to reach me, please refer to the discord link in workshop page."
