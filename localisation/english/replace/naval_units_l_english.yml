 submarine: "Submarine"
 submarine_desc: "§HSubmarine§!\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_ss_desc_icon\n\n\n\n\n\nThe submarine is the stealthy menace of the deep, a vessel that can strike from concealment with its deck guns or deadly torpedoes. While its role in a future war against enemy warships is clear, international practice still rightly restricts its use against merchant shipping, requiring them to surface and place crews in a place of safety before sinking a vessel. Technological advances are steadily improving their range, endurance, and reliability, making them a key element of fleet reconnaissance and a potent, if dreaded, weapon."
 both_cruisers_desc: "Light Cruiser - Evolved from protected cruiser and made more flexible, its primary duty is to shield capital ships from enemy light ships, but it can also unleash powerful torpedoes that can hurt bigger ships.\n\nHeavy Crusier - Evolved from protected cruiser and made larger, a large cruiser is equipped with 8-inch or bigger guns and fair armour. A good choice for nations who can't afford to build larger capital ships."
 light_cruiser: "Light Cruiser"
 light_cruiser_desc: "§HLight Cruiser§!\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_cl_desc_icon\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolved from protected cruiser and made more flexible, the light cruiser is the versatile workhorse of the fleet, typically armed with 6-inch guns. Its duties are myriad: scouting for the battle fleet, leading flotillas of destroyers in a torpedo attack, and defending against enemy destroyers. More numerous than their heavy cruiser cousins, they are the backbone of patrols and colonial presence."
 heavy_cruiser: "Heavy Capital Cruiser"
 heavy_cruiser_desc: "§HHeavy Cruiser§!\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_ca_desc_icon\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolved from protected cruiser and made larger, a heavy cruiser is equipped with 8-inch guns and fair armour. It is designed to be a long-range commerce protector and a formidable raider itself, or sometimes a vanguard of fleet, capable of outpacing any enemy battleship. Nations have built them in numbers, and they form a crucial component of cruiser squadrons."
 medium_cruiser: "Heavy Fleet Cruiser"
 medium_cruiser_desc: "§HHeavy Cruiser§!\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_ca_desc_icon\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolved from protected cruiser and made larger, a heavy cruiser is equipped with 8-inch guns and fair armour. A good choice for nations who can't afford to build larger capital ships.\nThis type of ship operates in screen line."
 destroyer: "Destroyer"
 destroyer_desc: "§HDestroyer§!\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_dd_desc_icon\n\n\n\n\n\nThe destroyer is the fleet's swift guardian and sharp striker. These nimble, torpedo-armed vessels are primarily tasked with screening the battle line from enemy destroyer attacks and delivering their own massed torpedo salvos against capital ships. Their secondary role in hunting submarines is becoming ever more critical with improvements in underwater boat technology. Though small and frail, a flotilla of destroyers presents a grave threat to even the largest ships."
 ship_hull_light: "Light Hull"
 ship_hull_light_desc: "The lightest screening vessel. Its job is to defend larger ships and to find and destroy submarines."
 carrier: "Carrier"
 carrier_desc: "§HAircraft Carrier§!\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_cv_desc_icon\n\n\n\n\n\nThe aircraft carrier is the most modern and rapidly evolving vessel in any major fleet. Converted from existing battlecruiser hulls or built from the keel up, these floating airfields are proving their worth in fleet exercises. Their squadrons of fighters, torpedo bombers, and scouts provide the fleet's eyes and a potent new striking arm. While their ability to influence a major surface engagement against the guns of a battleship is still a matter of heated debate, no one will doubt their great potential."
 battleship: "Battleship"
 battleship_desc: "§HBattleship§!\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_bb_desc_icon\n\n\n\n\n\nThe battleship remains the undisputed capital ship and the ultimate measure of a navy's power. These colossal vessels are defined by their immense firepower, derived from batteries of heavy guns ranging from 14 to 16 inches in caliber, and their extensive armour plating, designed to withstand fire from an enemy's equivalent broadside. The battle line, comprised of these magnificent ships, is still expected to decide any future fleet action."
 battle_cruiser: "Battlecruiser"
 battle_cruiser_desc: "§HBattlecruiser§!\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_bc_desc_icon\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a creation that strongly speaks to Lord John A. Fisher's style, the battlecruiser presents a fascinating and controversial concept: the armament of a battleship married to the speed of a cruiser, achieved by reducing armour protection. Their role is that of a super-cruiser; to hunt down enemy commerce raiders and serve as a powerful advanced scout for the main fleet. However, lessons from Jutland have led to serious debate about their survivability in a modern gunnery duel."
 convoy: "Convoy"
 convoy_desc: "Convoys used for international trade of goods and resources. Also used to ferry troops around and for performing naval invasions."
 SH_battleship: "Super Heavy Battleship"
 SH_battleship_desc: "§HSuper Heavy Battleship§!\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_shbb_desc_icon\n\n\n\n\n\nOften fantasized in the wildest dreams of naval architects, super heavy battleships have mostly remained blueprints or concepts in the past. While the building methods remain controversial, with enough money and determination, it is not a daydream to complete a huge ship like this."
 battlecarrier: "Battlecarrier"
 battlecarrier_desc: "§HBattlecarrier§!\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_bbv_desc_icon\n\n\n\n\n\nA large, often hypothetical, hybrid naval ship designed to combine aspects of both an aircraft carrier and either a battleship or battlecruiser."
 auxiliary_ship: "Auxiliary Ship"
 auxiliary_ship_desc: "A civilian standard auxiliary ship responsible for fleet supporting."
 
 cv_cas: "Dive Bomber (Carrier)"
 cv_CAS_equipment_desc: "A dive bomber is a bomber aircraft that dives directly at its targets in order to provide greater accuracy for the bomb it drops."
 cv_nav_bomber: "Torpedo Bomber (Carrier)"
 cv_nav_bomber_equipment_desc: "A torpedo bomber is a military aircraft designed primarily to attack ships with aerial torpedoes."
