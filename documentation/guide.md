# A Simple Guide to Vanilla Navy Rework #

## Preface ##
Hi, this is the author of VNR, MrPunk. VNR is a naval overhaul mod with a huge amount of new contents and mechanisms, though its core is still similar to vanilla. I bet most people, whether experienced in navy or not, might face a hard time adjusting to a fresh style of naval game. I'm not an expert, but I want to write down this guide with insights during my modding process, in an attempt to relieve players from duplicate learning.

You can play VNR in different ways. Stick to history if you want to do it in a realistic style, or create meta designs to simply be a winner. It's up to you which style to pick, and VNR always offers numerous things for you to achieve that.

## Designer ##
Designer is the basic of VNR and the most important components you deal with. To design a ship, you need to know about your requirements and more. A good navy does not always equal to the United States Navy in real life, but it should fit in your overall strategy and geopolitical environment. Fortunately, VNR has a wide range of modules to help you customize your fleet. To begin with, I'd like to bring up the six dimensions of ship designs.

### Philosophy of Balance ###

**Firepower**

Firepower in HOI4 is split into 3 types of attacks, light, heavy and torpedo.

Light attack is provided by batteries on destroyers and cruisers, and secondary batteries on capital ships. Heavy attack is the damage done by heavy batteries on battleships or battlecruisers, and medium guns on heavy cruisers by a very small amount. While damage caused by guns is affected by armor of target which their ratio leads to very different damage and critical chance, torpedo simply ignores armor and can cause great damage and score more critical hits, but it's fired more slowly and suffers a great penalty on hit chance when screen efficiency is good. Given that enemy's screen efficiency is one vital factor in the equation, swiftly eliminating its screen ships paves the way to a grand victory because low screen efficiency of the other side will make dynamics at sea more favorable to your side.

A conclusion can be drawn here. Light gun is very efficient against light ships, with the other side's screen efficiency totally crushed, your fleet will have an upper hand in hitting and evasion. Heavy gun can do more damage to heavy ships due to its heavy armor piercing effects, though it's not common to see battleships sunk by it. Torpedo have a higher critical chance against heavy ships and carriers which often deals triple or even quadruple damages, but its setbacks are long loading time and low hit chance.

Carrier, on the other hand, is very different from all the firepowers mentioned above. Its damage relies on your air variants and sortie efficiency, and is only affected by weather, anti-air and night. 

**Protection**

The protection of ships varies on different hulls. For example, destroyer has close to zero protection, cruiser has armor plates, while battleship possesses armor, scheme and torpedo defense systems.

When HP gets reduced to 0, the ship will be sunk. Typically, the two ways to avoid it will be enhancing your ship in terms of HP and armor strength. Having more HP brings obvious benefits that the ship can take more damage before sunk. Armor improves survivability with a different approach to reduce damage received each time it's hit. Based on the formula listed in intro panel, if armor piercing of a gun is lower than half of the armor, its damage is reduced to 20% of its original value. As a result, armor is extremely useful against guns.

Torpedo completely ignores armor and can cause great damage. Even torpedo defense system is not effective enough to save the ship if it gets hit by torpedo. But luckily, with a good escort force, torpedo will have a hard time penetrating the screen line to get your capital ships.

Contrary to most people's impression, anti-air is also a part of protection facing aircrafts and carriers. Good AA provides damage reduction or even evasion when attacked by planes, and it gets more bonus from the overall AA from your fleet, factored to align with the ship's. That means a ship without anti-air gun can also benefits from other ships' AA, but anti-air guns are mandatory if you want to shoot down the plane.

**Speed**

Besides stacking armor, another way to improve your ship's survivability is to increase its speed. Higher speed helps reduce ship's hit profile which is compared with hit chance of guns to determine whether your ship is hit or not. As an effective measure to evade gun fires, however, speed is useless against planes. In order to get a higher speed, avoid stacking too many guns or armors on a hull. Generally speaking, you'd better make capital ships around 30kn, light ships 35-40kn.

**Reliability**

The impact of reliability is not superficial, but it determines how likely the ship may suffer a critical hit or damaged in accidents. Many immature or complex modules such as quad guns and missiles will cause loss of reliability, making the ship very vulnerable in combat and training, just like the Swedish warship Wasa. In my opinion, low reliability is somewhat tolerable on platforms with higher HP, but is's definitely not recommended on light hulls.

**Detection**

Detection, or recon, is a very important factor to gain initiativeness in naval combat. It is divided into surface detection and sub detection, with influence on spotting enemy fleet or submarines. Greater detection is always good, but it's also expensive, so only vanguard fleet is usually composed of fast and dedicated recon ships.

**Cost**

Unless you are playing as US or UK, building a large fleet takes too much time and IC, and it may hamper your army production. This is especially true for countries like Germany or Soviet Union which requires army focus more than anyone else. As a result, keeping the cost of shipbuilding programs under control can make the whole experience of your game smoother.

### How to Design Your Ship ###

If you can fully understand the six dimensions, now it's time to design your first ship!

**Carrier**

Carrier serves as the main source of damage in battle, and it's heavily relied on its aircrafts. The most important thing about it is the capacity, which requires you to mount as many hangars as possible. However, having too many hangars will certainly degrade speed and other metrics, especially that organisation and HP will impact sortie efficiency. Thus, you should keep the degradation under control.

**Heavy Ship**

You can't skip heavy ships, such as battleships and battlecruisers, in your fleet. While screen ships escort capital ships, these heavy ships will escort carriers and boost their survivability by drawing aircrafts' attack.  It's hard to summarize the key to such ship because it literally needs every aspect to be perfectly balanced. Firepower may not be the keypoint on battleships since their maximum HP is almost immortal compared to guns' heavy attack, but armor and AA are needed to protect itself and other ships, especially carriers. In that case, a historical battleship is more than sufficient to be included in a strike taskforce.

On the other hand, battlecruiser is not a good option despite its advantage of speed. Its chance to receive critical hit is higher than battleship, which battleship with high speed engine is already fast enough.

As for super heavy battleships, you can mount one gun on it to fully utilize its high HP, but normally it's not recommended.

**Cruiser**

Unlike vanilla, heavy cruiser and light cruiser in VNR are not defined by its gun caliber but by role. Yet there are still differences between cruiser guns. Light medium guns are similar to their origins, but medium guns have bonus on HP and armor to simulate a linear relation between survivability and tonnage. In VNR, heavy cruiser plays the role of cruiser killer instead of being useless in capital line, it's more flexible and can perform actions in both capital line and screen line based on the role you give it. As mentioned above, cruisers use light attack to eliminate screen ships and crush enemy's screen efficiency, creating a more favorable situation for your fleet to fire on the enemy. To achieve that, you need to pursue a fast and light-gun-centric design in order to keep up with destroyers and wipe out enemy's screen line as fast as you can.

Cruiser is not only used for attack, but also some supporting jobs, such as scouting, and sometimes it can be a luxurious option for anti-submarine and mine warfare. That's where the role system gonna help you to fully dig out all its potentials. Radar picket cruiser is perfect for spotting enemy fleet. Colonial cruiser is cheaper, good supplement to colonial empire like UK and also a second best choice for minor countries. Then you have large cruiser and missile cruiser if there are sufficient IC power within your nation. The list goes on, but one thing for sure is that cruiser offers the most possibilities in all kinds of ships.

**Destroyer**

Destroyer is weak at the first glance, but it has the best speed and visibility in the game. Since destroyer's gun is almost useless against any ships but itself, torpedo is often used as the main weapon of destroyer, making destroyer heavily depending on the diminishment of your enemy's screen efficiency. Besides, destroyers also shoulder the most important mission in the fleet, which is to maintain screen efficiency by their numbers. Therefore, cost should always be the top priority when designing a destroyer, and there are a series of roles to achieve that. 

Typically, the generic destroyer role can handle most scenarios. Escort destroyer is cheaper and expert at anti-submarine, and frigate can reduce the cost even more with numerous degradations in other aspects. Of course, you can also try to go another way to improve quality of your destroyer. Roles like destroyer leader and super destroyer can both enhance its performance in terms of firepower and protection at the cost of a sharp increase in IC. Destroyer leader may look redundant in the list, you are correct, that's also the reason why this type of ships was eventually outdated in history.

**Submarine**

Subs are greatly nerfed compared to vanilla in terms of competing with a proper fleet, but they are still lethal towards convoys. There isn't much choice for each slot on submarine like other ships, and that makes the design of submarines quite linear and easier since all you have to do is updating it with new hulls or new modules.

AI in VNR has been enhanced to carry more depth charges and sonars, which is a major challenge to sub-centric games. As a result, you should try to lower your sub visibility as much as possible. Mount every useful module, including snorkel and pressure hull, on your sub and keep them updated to the latest.

### Special Hulls ###

Special hulls are ships that can't be simply represented by generic ship hulls. They are made for flavor and immersion. Using them does not always give you a good result in naval battle.

**Battlecarrier**

Battlecarrier is a hybrid ship with features from both battleship and carrier, you can make one by putting conversion deck on rear slots of the heavy hull. Although it has heavy guns, battlecarrier is considered as carrier and is in the carrier line, and it's restricted by the max carrier limit. Furthermore, battlecarrier can't get any bonus from doctrines, and its high conversion cost also blocks the possibility to build the fleet around it.

**Super Heavy Battleship**

In fact, super heavy battleship has no fundamental difference from ordinary battleships. It's just larger and more expensive with dedicated armor and engines.

**Escort Carrier**

A cheap but very weak carrier. Escort carrier is unlocked around 1940-1941 in the techtree, it's basically a toy for major powers as the carrier count limit largely restricts its usage scenario, but it's still a perfect choice for anti-submarine missions in secondary theaters.

**Super Carrier**

Just like Essex or Midway post-refit, super carrier is a weapon with no shortcoming. By combining with modern carrier modules such as large armored hangar, steamed catapult and side lifts, a super carrier can possess a capacity of 130-150 planes. Except for its incredible cost, super carrier is the best type of carrier in the mod.

**Panzerschiff**

Panzerschiff in VNR or revived armored cruiser in KRNR, is basically a cruiser with heavy guns, though there is a limit set to prevent super heavy guns being installed on it. Just like the real armored ship in history, it has some advantages in one-on-one combat against cruisers, such as better guns and armor, making it an intermediate option between battlecruiser and heavy cruiser. The problem is, panzerschiff is stuck in the middle, so it can't fully cover either's job.

**Auxiliary Ship**

The max range of the fleet is calculated by average range of all ships within, so mathematically speaking you can boost it by adding long-range ships to your fleet. However, if you know maths very well, you may notice once the average surpass a certain value, it will bring the increase rate to a stagnation, so it's unwise to put too many auxiliary ships together because the range bonus is reaching the upper limit.

To keep it away from the frontline, auxiliary ship is considered as capital ship, which means it can provide escort efficiency for your carrier just like battleship does. It's weak without doubt, but really really cheap.
