# A Simple Guide to Vanilla Navy Rework #

## Preface ##
Hi, this is the author of VNR, MrPunk. VNR is a naval overhaul mod with a huge amount of new contents and mechanisms, though its core is still similar to vanilla, I bet most people, whether experienced in navy or not, might face a hard time adjusting to a fresh style of naval game. I'm not an expert in naval games, but I want to write down this guide with insights during my modding process, in an attempt to relieve players from duplicate learning.

You can play VNR in different ways. Stick to history if you want to do it in a realistic style, or create meta designs to simply be a winner. It's up to you which style to pick, and VNR always offers numerous things for you to achieve that.

## Designer ##
Designer is the basic of VNR and the most important components you deal with. To design a ship, you need to know about your requirements and more. A good navy does not always equal to the United States Navy in real life, but it should fit in your overall strategy and geopolitical environment. Fortunately, VNR has a wide range of modules to help you customize your fleet. To begin with, I'd like to bring up the six dimensions of ship designs.

### Philosophy of Balance ###

**Firepower**

Firepower in HOI4 is split into 3 types of attacks, light, heavy and torpedo.

Light attack is provided by batteries on destroyers and cruisers, and secondary batteries on capital ships. Heavy attack is the damage done by heavy batteries on battleships or battlecruisers, and medium guns on heavy cruisers by a very small amount. While damage caused by guns is affected by armor of target which their ratio leads to very different damage and critical chance, torpedo simply ignores armor and can cause great damage and score more critical hits, but it's fired more slowly and suffers a great penalty on hit chance when screen efficiency is good. Given that enemy's screen efficiency is one vital factor in the equation, swiftly eliminating its screen ships paves the way to a grand victory because low screen efficiency will make the dynamics at sea more favorable to your side.

A conclusion can be drawn here. Light gun is very efficient against light ships, with the other side's screen efficiency totally crushed, your fleet will have an upper hand in hitting and evasion. Heavy gun can do more damage to heavy ships due to its heavy armor piercing effects, though it's quite rare to see battleships sunk by it. Torpedo have a higher critical chance against heavy ships and carriers which often deals triple or even quadruple damages, but its setbacks are long loading time and low hit chance.

Carrier, on the other hand, is very different from all the firepowers mentioned above. Its damage relies on your air variants and sortie efficiency, and is only affected by weather, anti-air and night. 

**Protection**

The protection of ships varies on different hulls. For example, destroyer has close to zero protection, cruiser has armor plates, while battleship possesses armor, scheme and torpedo defense systems.

When HP gets reduced to 0, the ship will be sunk. Typically, the two ways to avoid it will be enhancing your ship in terms of HP and armor strength. Having more HP brings obvious benefits that the ship can take more damage before sunk. Armor improves survivability with a different approach to reduce damage received each time it's hit. Based on the formula listed in intro panel, if armor piercing of a gun is lower than half of the armor, its damage is reduced to 20% of its original value. As a result, armor is extremely useful against guns.

Torpedo completely ignores armor and can cause great damage. Even torpedo defense system is not effective enough to save the ship if it gets hit by torpedo. But luckily, with a good escort force, torpedo will have a hard time penetrating the screen line to get your capital ships.

Contrary to most people's impression, anti-air is also a part of protection facing aircrafts and carriers. Good AA provides damage reduction or even evasion when attacked by planes, and it gets more bonus from the overall AA from your fleet, factored to align with the ship's. That means a ship without anti-air gun can also benefits from other ships' AA, but anti-air guns are mandatory if you want to shoot down the plane.

**Speed**

Besides stacking armor, another way to improve your ship's survivability is to increase its speed. Higher speed helps reduce ship's hit profile which is compared with hit chance of guns to determine whether your ship is hit or not. As an effective measure to evade gun fires, however, speed is useless against planes. In order to get a higher speed, avoid stacking too many guns or armors on a hull. Generally speaking, you'd better make capital ships around 30kn, light ships 35-40kn.

**Reliability**

The impact of reliability is not superficial, but it determines how likely the ship may suffer a critical hit or damaged in accidents. Many immature or complex modules such as quad guns and missiles will cause loss of reliability, making the ship very vulnerable in combat and training, just like the Swedish warship Wasa. In my opinion, low reliability is somewhat tolerable on platforms with higher HP, but is's definitely not recommended on light hulls.

**Detection**

Detection, or recon, is a very important factor to gain initiativeness in naval combat. It is divided into surface detection and sub detection, with influence on spotting enemy fleet or submarines. Greater detection is always good, but it's also expensive, so only vanguard fleet is usually composed of fast and dedicated recon ships.

**Cost**

Unless you are playing as US or UK, building a large fleet takes too much time and IC, and it may hamper your army production. This is especially true for countries like Germany or Soviet Union which requires army focus more than anyone else. As a result, keeping the cost of shipbuilding programs under control can make the whole experience of your game smoother.
