# Vanilla Navy Rework
This is Vanilla Navy Rework, a mod for Hearts of Iron 4. All files will be kept here.

---Introduction---
VNR is a project originated from Kaiserreich Navy Rework. The intention of this mod is to create a soft-core, RP-oriented naval experience with as few changes as possible applied to vanilla naval system.
Please don't expect too much competitiveness out of this mod, for it is not designed to make you feel painful against AI.
Subscribe this mod if you love:
-Historical/realistic ship design
-Historical navy lineups, a more immersive WWII naval combat experience
-Want unique icons more than those default vanilla ones
-More reasonable AI naval designs/production strategy
-Naval history

---Compatibility---
The mod targets to be compatible with any national focus/event/decision mods and other minor fixes mods, but it's not compatible with alt-history and tech mods. Please use at your own risk.
-Only 1936 scenario supported
-To ensure the best compatibility, the mod uses post-loading mechanism to avoid overwriting any country history files. So don't panic when you find fleet and tech tree missing at game start, click continue on the intro panel, and everything will be set.
-The cost of such compatibility is that all national focus/events/decisions which grants you ship designs will be broken, though it won't crash the game. Naval tech focus or such won't be affected. Please just ignore that.
